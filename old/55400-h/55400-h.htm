      CHAPTER I
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">D</span>EUTSCHLAND,
      Deutschland über alles!&rdquo; Three thousand voices blended and swelled in the
      powerful harmony. The walls of the Fenchester Auditorium trembled to it.
      The banners, with their German mottoes of welcome, swayed to the rhythm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Über alles in der Welt!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The thundering descent of the line with its superb resonances was as
      martial as a cavalry charge. Three thousand flushed, perspiring,
      commonplace faces above respectable black coats in the one sex and mildly
      ornate blouses in the other, were caught by the fire and the ferment of it
      and grew suddenly rapt and ecstatic. Wave after wave of massed harmonies
      followed in the onset. One could feel, rather than hear, in the
      impassioned voices a spirit instantly more fanatic, more exotic, a strange
      and exultant note, as of challenge. It was inspiring. It was startling. It
      was formidable. It was anything for which young Mr. Jeremy Robson, down in
      the reporters&rsquo; seats, might find an adjective, except, perhaps, American.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet this was the American city of Fenchester, capital of the sovereign
      State of Centralia, in the year of grace and peace, nineteen hundred and
      twelve, half a decade before the United States of America descended into
      the Valley of the Shadow of Death to face the German guns, thundering out
      that same chorus of &ldquo;Germany over all in the world!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All the Federated German Societies of the State of Centralia in annual
      convention assembled might sing their federated German heads off for all
      that Jeremy Robson cared. He mildly approved the music, not so much for
      the sense as for the sound, under cover of which he was enabled to
      question his neighbor, Galpin, of The Guardian, concerning the visiting
      notabilities upon the stage. For young Mr. Robson was still a bit new to
      his work on The Record, and rather flattered that an assignment of this
      importance should have fallen to him. The local and political celebrities
      he already knew&mdash;the Governor; the Mayor; Robert Wanser, President of
      the Fenchester Trust Company; State Senator Martin Embree; Carey Crobin,
      the &ldquo;Boss of the Ward&rdquo;; Emil Bausch, President of the local Deutscher
      Club; and a dozen of the other leading citizens, all ornamented with
      conspicuous badges. Galpin obligingly indicated the principal strangers.
      Gordon Fliess, of Bellair, head of the Fliess Brewing Company; the
      Reverend Theo Gunst, the militant ecclesiast of a near-by German
      Theological Seminary; Ernst Bauer, of the Marlittstown Herold und Zeitung;
      Pastor Klink, the recognized head of the German religious press of the
      region; Martin Dolge, accredited with being the dictator of the State&rsquo;s
      educational system; and the Herr Professor Koerner, of the University of
      Felsingen, special envoy from Germany to the United States for the
      propagation of that wide-spread and carefully fostered Teutonic plant,
      Deutschtum, the spirit of German Kultur in foreign lands.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the close of the musical exaltation of Germany above all the world,
      including, of course, the hospitably adoptive nation under whose
      protection the singers sat, the exercises proceeded with a verbal
      glorification of the Fatherland. The Governor, in complimentary and
      carefully memorized German, lauded the Teutons as the prop of the State.
      The Mayor, in strongly Teutonized English, proclaimed them the hope of the
      city. Several other speakers, whose accents identified them as more
      American than their sentiments, acclaimed the upholders of Deutschtum as
      salt of the earth and pillars of Society. Then a chorus of public school
      children, in the colors of imperial Germany rose to sing &ldquo;Die Wacht am
      Rhein,&rdquo; and everybody rose with them, or nearly everybody. They sang it
      directly in the face of his Imperial Majesty, Kaiser Wilhelm, gazing,
      bewreathed, down at them from over the stage, with stern and martial
      approval.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They do it mighty well,&rdquo; commented young Jeremy Robson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay-ah. Why would n&rsquo;t they!&rdquo; returned Galpin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean they&rsquo;ve been specially drilled for it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Specially nothing! That&rsquo;s part of their regular school exercises.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the German schools?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the <i>public</i> schools. Our schools. Paid for out of our taxes.
      &lsquo;Come to order.&rsquo; Tap-tap-tap with Teacher&rsquo;s ruler. &lsquo;Der bupils will now
      rice und zing &ldquo;Die Wacht am Rhein.&rdquo;&rsquo; But try em with &lsquo;America,&rsquo; and they
      would n&rsquo;t know the first verse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem to feel strongly about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in working hours. Have n&rsquo;t got any feelings. I&rsquo;m a reporter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From this point the programme was exclusively in German. The next speaker,
      Pastor Klink, rose and glorified God, a typically if not exclusively
      German God. Emil Bausch, following, extolled the Kaiser rather more
      piously than his predecessor had glorified the Kaiser&rsquo;s Creator. Martin
      Dolge apostrophized the spirit of Deutschtum, which, if one might believe
      him, was invented by the Creator and improved by the Kaiser. Just here
      occurred an unfortunate break in the programme. The next speaker on the
      list had been called out, and an interim must be filled while he was
      retrieved. The chairman motioned to the band leader for music. Whether in
      a spirit of perversity or by sheer, unhappy chance, the director led his
      men in the strains of &ldquo;The Star-Spangled Banner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In justice to our citizens of German descent and allegiance, it must be
      admitted that they are of equable spirit. Nobody openly resented the
      playing of the national anthem. A glance of disapproval passed between the
      professorial envoy from Germany and Pastor Klink, and some of the others
      on the stage frowned momentarily. But their habitual tolerant good nature
      at once reasserted itself. Of course, no one rose; that gesture was
      reserved for the German national music. No one, that is who counted, in
      that assemblage. But from the reporters&rsquo; seats Jeremy Robson and Galpin
      dimly made out a figure, long-coated, straw-hatted and slim, in the first
      row of the balcony&rsquo;s farthest corner, standing stiffly erect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Around it buzzed a small disturbance. There were sounds of laughter, which
      spread and mingled with a few calls of disapprobation. A woman beside the
      erect figure seemed to be making an effort at dissuasion. It was
      unavailing. On the stage there were curious looks and queries. Presently
      the whole house was gazing at the slender, lone figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s the kid?&rdquo; asked Jeremy Robson, interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know him,&rdquo; answered Galpin, staring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like his nerve, anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s better than his style,&rdquo; commented the other, grinning. &ldquo;If he&rsquo;s
      going to stand to attention, why does n&rsquo;t he take off his hat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s another one,&rdquo; said The Guardian reporter, turning toward the lower
      tier box on their right.
    </p>
    <p>
      An iron-gray, square-jawed man with shrewd and pleasant eyes, who, in his
      obviously expensive but easy-fitting suit of homespun, gave the impression
      of physical power, was shouldering his way to the rail. A small American
      flag occupied a humble position in a group of insignia ornamenting the
      next box. The man plucked it out and made as if he would raise it above
      his head, then changed his mind. Holding it stiffly in front of him he
      turned to face the distant figure, and so stood, grim, awkward, solid,
      while the chosen voice of the Nation&rsquo;s patriotism sang to unheeding ears
      below.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Movie stuff,&rdquo; observed Jeremy Robson with that cynicism which every young
      reporter considers proper to his profession.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s Magnus Laurens,&rdquo; said his mentor. &ldquo;Nothing theatrical about
      Magnus. He&rsquo;s a reg&rsquo;lar feller.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The novice was impressed. For Laurens was a name of prestige throughout
      Centralia. Its owner controlled the water-power of the State and was a
      growing political figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s he doing it for?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because he&rsquo;s an American, I suppose. Queer reason, ain&rsquo;t it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s another, then,&rdquo; returned Robson, as there arose, from a front row
      seat on the stage, the strong and graceful figure of Martin Embree, State
      Senator from the Northern Tier where the Germans make up three fourths of
      the population.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trust Smiling Mart to do the tactful thing,&rdquo; observed Galpin. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s the
      guy that invented popularity, and he&rsquo;s held the patent ever since.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Senator was wearing his famous smile which was both a natural ornament
      and a political asset. He directed it upon Magnus Laurens who did not see
      it, turned it toward the slim patriot in the gallery who may or may not
      have observed it, and then carried it close to the ear of the chairman.
      Snatches of his eager and low-toned persuasion floated down to the
      listening Robson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;... all up. Can&rsquo;t... harm. National... after all. If don&rsquo;t want...
      leave... me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The chairman shook his head glumly, broke loose from the smile, spoke a
      word to the erring orchestra leader. The music stopped. The figure in the
      balcony sank into the dimness of its background. Magnus Laurens sat down.
      Senator Embree, smiling and gracious still, returned to his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s my story,&rdquo; said young Jeremy Robson, ever on the lookout for the
      picturesque. &ldquo;If I can find that kid,&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Try Magnus Laurens,&rdquo; suggested his elder. &ldquo;Maybe he knows him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Throughout the address of the Herr Professor Koerner, young Mr. Robson sat
      absently making notes. The notes were wholly irrelevant to the learned
      envoy&rsquo;s speech. Yet it was an interesting, even a significant speech, had
      there been any in those easy days, to appreciate its significance. The
      learned representative of German propaganda impressed upon his hearers the
      holy purpose of Deutschtum. German ties must be maintained; German habits
      and customs of life and above all the German speech must be piously
      fostered at whatever distance from the Fatherland, to the end that, in the
      inevitable day when Germany&rsquo;s oppressors, jealous of her power and
      greatness, should force her to draw the sword in self-defense, every scion
      of German blood might rally to her, against the world, if need be. Amidst
      the &ldquo;Hochs!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Sehr guts!&rdquo; which punctuated the oratory, the negligent
      reporter for The Record sat sketching the outlines of his word-picture of
      the stripling in the gallery and the magnate in the box, standing to honor
      their country&rsquo;s anthem, amidst the amused and patronizing wonderment of
      the Federated German Societies of Centralia. As the session drew to a
      close, he left.
    </p>
    <p>
      Magnus Laurens had already gone. By good fortune, young Jeremy Robson
      caught a glimpse of his square and powerful figure, emerging from the
      crowd and going down a side street. A girl in a riding-habit was with him.
      In the bearing of her slender body, in the poise of the little head with
      its tight-packed strands of tawny hair, Jeremy Robson caught a hint of a
      subtle and innate quality, something gallant and proud and challenging. He
      overtook them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, Mr. Laurens. My name is Robson. I&rsquo;m a reporter for The
      Record. Could I have a word with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The water-power magnate turned upon him a face of mingled annoyance and
      amusement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is what I get for making a spectacle of myself, I take it,&rdquo; he
      grumbled. &ldquo;What do you want to know? Why I did it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. That&rsquo;s plain enough. Who was the boy in the balcony?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boy?&rdquo; repeated Mr. Laurens in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. The kid that stood up when they began &lsquo;The Star-Spangled Banner.&rsquo; Do
      you know him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me refer that question to Miss Marcia Ames. She was right at the
      spot, in the balcony. Miss Ames, Mr. Robson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy bowed and found himself looking into two large, young, and
      extremely self-possessed grayish eyes, frank and happy eyes on the
      surface, but with inscrutable lights and depths beneath. For the rest, his
      hasty impression recorded an alert, intelligent, and delicately slanted
      face, and an almost disconcertingly direct regard. The skin was of that
      translucent brown-over-pink which the sun god bestows only upon his tried
      and true acolytes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know the boy, Miss Ames?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What boy?&rdquo; Her voice was cool and liquid and endearing, and just a bit
      lazily indifferent, with a strange hint&mdash;never anything more&mdash;of
      accent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The boy who stood in the first row of the balcony.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was not a boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You! You&rsquo;re much too tall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you thought me a boy I should seem much shorter,&rdquo; she returned
      composedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mind telling me how you came to stand up as you did?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I always do when they play my national anthem. Do not you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The &ldquo;do not you&rdquo; gave the young man the clue to her speech, to the
      slightly exotic quality of it. It was less the accent than the clear
      precision of her use of words, without the slur or contraction of common
      usage. The charm of her soft and rather deep voice saved it from any taint
      of the pedantic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah? But perhaps you are not an American.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What else should I be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shrugged her shoulders slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor do I,&rdquo; put in Magnus Laurens, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ashamed to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At all events, you did it this time. It was very nice in you. Usually I
      feel quite lonely. And once they were going to arrest me for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where was that?&rdquo; asked Jeremy Robson stealthily reaching for his folded
      square of scratch paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In Germany. When I was at school there. Are you going to put all this in
      the paper?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you mind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I ought to mind. It is very forward and unmaidenly, is it not,
      to permit one&rsquo;s self to be dragged into print?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is,&rdquo; said Magnus Laurens, his shrewd eyes twinkling, &ldquo;and about one
      hundred and one maidens out of every hundred just love it, according to my
      observations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not think that I should object,&rdquo; said Miss Ames calmly. &ldquo;In fact I
      should be curious to see what you would say about me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was Jeremy Robson&rsquo;s first intimation of her unique frankness of
      attitude toward herself as toward all other persons and things.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are on our way to the hotel where Mrs. Laurens is waiting for us,&rdquo;
       explained the water-power dictator. &ldquo;Why not walk along with us while you
      conclude the interview?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have n&rsquo;t much more to ask Miss Ames,&rdquo; said the reporter, complying,
      &ldquo;except what started her on her patriotic habit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father was an army officer,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;While he was alive we
      always stood up together. Now I could no more sit through &lsquo;The
      Star-Spangled Banner&rsquo; than you would wear your hat in church. But I really
      do not see anything to write about in <i>that</i>. There was much, surely,
      more interesting at the meeting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, for instance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The whole affair,&rdquo; she said vaguely. &ldquo;It seemed to me strange. What are
      so many German subjects doing over here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those aren&rsquo;t German subjects, my dear,&rdquo; said Mr. Laurens. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re
      American citizens, mostly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely not!&rdquo; exclaimed the girl. &ldquo;The German flags, and the pictures of
      the Emperor, and all the talk about the German spirit, and&mdash;and
      &lsquo;Deutschland über alles.&rsquo; From <i>Americans?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said the reporter. &ldquo;And good ones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think they would better be called good Germans. One cannot
      imagine that sort of thing occurring in a German city. I mean if the case
      were reversed, and Americans wanted to hold such a meeting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No? What would happen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Verboten. Lèse-majesté. Anti-imperialismus. Something dreadful of that
      sort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They aren&rsquo;t as broad-minded in such things as we are,&rdquo; observed Mr.
      Laurens, in a tone which, caused young Jeremy Robson to glance at him
      curiously and then become thoughtful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you notice that fat and glossy person on the stage, the one who had
      just made that speech&mdash;what was his name? Bausch, I think&mdash;did
      you notice his patronizing grin when you got up, Mr. Laurens? As if he
      felt a calm superiority to your second-rate patriotism.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a malicious young person!&rdquo; said Laurens. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s really no harm in
      Bausch that can&rsquo;t be blown off like froth from beer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose there <i>is</i> a story in all that,&rdquo; ruminated young Jeremy
      Robson: &ldquo;if I had the sense to see it. Maybe it would take a historian&rsquo;s
      mind instead of a reporter&rsquo;s to see it right. But I think I can get some
      of it into my &lsquo;Star-Spangled Banner&rsquo; story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good luck to you and it, then,&rdquo; said Magnus Laurens cordially. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like
      to see some one in this town at this time point out that, after all,
      America is America.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you?&rdquo; said the girl. &ldquo;Walk around to the next block and I will show
      you what I saw this morning as I passed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They followed her around the corner and stopped before a tiny shop with a
      giant&rsquo;s boot swinging in front of it. The legend over the door read:
    </p>
    <p>
      Boot &amp; Shoe Infirmary Eli Wade, Surgeon
    </p>
    <p>
      Across the window was stretched a brand-new American flag, and beneath it
      a second legend, roughly inked on packing-paper and secured to the glass
      with cobbler&rsquo;s wax:
    </p>
    <p>
      The Flag of Our Country. It stands alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two beribboned, bespangled, bebadged German Federates passed near them,
      and paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the man who refused to decorate with <i>our</i> colors,&rdquo; said
      one, in German.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pfui!&rdquo; said the second contemptuously, &ldquo;&rsquo;s machts nichts. Matters
      noding!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy Robson took off his hat and made his adieus. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve given me
      something to think about,&rdquo; he said, apportioning his acknowledgment
      impartially, though his eyes were on the strange and alluring face of
      Marcia Ames. &ldquo;Good-bye, and thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re grateful for being made to think,&rdquo; returned Magnus Laurens,
      good-humoredly, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s hope for you as a reporter yet. That&rsquo;s a
      good-looking boy,&rdquo; he added to his companion, as the young man turned
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-looking?&rdquo; she repeated, with a rising inflection that controverted
      the opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, not a young Adonis. But there&rsquo;s something under that thatch of hair
      of his or I&rsquo;m no guesser. Grit, and purpose, and, I think, honesty. I hope
      he does n&rsquo;t make hash of us in his paper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Allowing himself an hour and a half, the reporter turned out in that time
      what he firmly believed to be &ldquo;a pippin of a story.&rdquo; After delivering the
      final page to an approving copy-reader he washed up, got his coat and hat
      and started for the door. In the hallway he came upon Senator Martin
      Embree, just closing a conversation with Farley, the editor-in-chief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No politics in this, you know,&rdquo; the Senator was saying, in his sunny
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; said Farley. &ldquo;If there were&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;d probably be on opposite sides as usual. This is simply a case of not
      stirring up useless ill-feeling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite right. And we&rsquo;re much obliged to you. As long as The Guardian won&rsquo;t
      touch it, you can rely on us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was sure I could.&rdquo; The Senator turned and came face to face with the
      reporter. &ldquo;Hello, Mr. Robson,&rdquo; he said with his enveloping smile, and
      Jeremy went on feeling that the world was a more friendly place, for
      having encountered that expression of human good-will.
    </p>
    <p>
      He descended into Fenchester&rsquo;s main street. For the day, it might have
      been a foreign city. It was all aflutter with streamers inscribed
      &ldquo;Wilkommen&rdquo; followed by sundry German tags. German speech crossed German
      speech in the humming air. German faces, moist, heavy-hued, good-humored,
      were lifted to the insignia of the various Bunds, Vereins, Gesellschafts,
      and Kranzes, all pledged to the fostering and maintenance of a tenacious
      and irreconcilable foreign culture in the carelessly hospitable land which
      they had adopted as their own. Over streets, residences, stores, public
      buildings waved the banners of imperial Germany.
    </p>
    <p>
      Far above it all, from the dome of the capitol, floated the Stars and
      Stripes. The flag represented a formality. It meant nothing in particular
      to anybody, except that the Legislature was then in session. Weaving in
      the languid air, it seemed remote, lonely, occluded from the jovial
      fellowship of the swarming Teuton colors. For the time, at least, it had
      been put aside from men&rsquo;s minds. It was an alien in the land whose sons
      had died for it, and would again die for it in a day drawing inevitably
      nearer.

      CHAPTER II
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE pippin of a
      story never ripened into print. Young Mr. Robson&rsquo;s formal report of the
      meeting, a staid bit of journalism, appeared in full. But not a word of
      that brilliant pen-picture which he had so affectionately worked out. With
      a flaccid hope that there might have been a mistake somewhere, its author
      perused the columns of The Record a second time. Nothing! Perhaps,
      whispered hope, they had held it over. Being of the &ldquo;sketch&rdquo; order, it was
      good at any time. Daring greatly, he invaded the editorial sanctum where
      the proof-hooks hang. On the second he found his work of art. Upon the
      margin was rubber-stamped a single word: &ldquo;<i>Killed</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Young Jeremy Robson felt as if that lethal monosyllable had been
      simultaneously imprinted upon his journalistic ambitions. Like salt to the
      smart of his professional hurt came another thought. What would Miss
      Marcia Ames think of him when she opened the paper and found nothing of
      the promised article there? Would there be disappointment in the depths of
      those disturbing eyes? Or&mdash;more probable and intolerable supposition&mdash;laughter
      at the expense of the young cockerel of a reporter who had crowed so
      confidently about what he was going to do? Happily for the reporter&rsquo;s
      immediate future, Mr. Farley had departed. For, were that mild, editorial
      gentleman still available for the purpose, young Jeremy Robson had
      straightway bearded him in his lair, demanded an explanation, denounced
      him as a soggy-souled Philistine, thrown his job in his teeth, and if he
      had exhibited symptoms of being &ldquo;snooty&rdquo; (the word is of young Mr.
      Robson&rsquo;s off-duty hours, and he must be responsible therefor), bunged him
      one in the eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      At which critical point young Mr. Robson came to and laughed at himself,
      albeit somewhat ruefully. It was his saving grace that already he had
      learned to laugh at himself. Many an equally high-spirited youngster has
      gone to the devil, because he let the devil get in his laugh first.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Souvenir of a lost masterpiece,&rdquo; observed Jeremy, folding the galley for
      accommodation to his pocket. He decided to take his medicine; to say no
      word of the matter to any one, though he would mightily have liked to know
      why the story was killed.
    </p>
    <p>
      His resolution of silence was abandoned as the result of a meeting with
      Andrew Galpin on the following morning. The Guardian man accosted him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did n&rsquo;t see your &lsquo;Star-Spangled&rsquo; story, Bo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What became of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Killed. What became of yours?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did n&rsquo;t? write any.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a reporter; that&rsquo;s why. Why queer your paper by writing American
      stuff on a German day!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think that&rsquo;s why my stuff was killed?&rdquo; asked Robson, impressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay-ah,&rdquo; assented Galpin. &ldquo;What did <i>you</i> think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought perhaps it was n&rsquo;t good enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bunk!&rdquo; said the downright Galpin. &ldquo;You did n&rsquo;t think it at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I did n&rsquo;t,&rdquo; admitted his junior, reddening. &ldquo;I read it over in
      proof. I think it&rsquo;s dam&rsquo; good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the talk! Got a proof with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see.&rdquo; Galpin leaned against a convenient railing, and proceeded to
      absorb, rather than read, the two-thirds column, with the practiced
      swiftness of his craft. &ldquo;Ayah. You&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; he corroborated. &ldquo;It <i>is</i>
      dam&rsquo; good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But not good enough for The Record.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too good. It&rsquo;s got too much guts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy Robson repeated the rugged Saxon word in a tone of uncomprehending
      inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too American,&rdquo; expounded the other. &ldquo;Too much
      &lsquo;This-is-our-country-and-don&rsquo;t-you-forget-it&rsquo; in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Show me one line where&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s between the lines. You could n&rsquo;t keep it out with barbed wire. You
      &rsquo;re no reporter,&rdquo; said Andrew Galpin severely. &ldquo;What d&rsquo; you think
      you&rsquo;re writing for The Record? Poetry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here!&rdquo; said the bewildered Robson. &ldquo;You just said it was good and
      now&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now I&rsquo;m telling you it&rsquo;s rotten. Punk! <i>As</i> newspaper work, <i>for</i>
      The Record. Or any other paper hereabouts on this great and glorious
      German day. Why, it&rsquo;d spoil the breakfast beer of every good and superior
      citizen of German birth and extraction that read it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then they are n&rsquo;t any sort of Americans if they can&rsquo;t stand that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Bah&rsquo; said Mary&rsquo;s little lamb to Mary,&rdquo; observed Mr. Galpin impolitely.
      &ldquo;Who said they were Americans? Did you hear much American at that meeting?
      Did you catch any loud and frenzied cheering for the red, white, and blue,
      or get your eyesight overcrowded with photographs of the American eagle?
      Did you mistake the picture of the gent with the wild-boar whiskerines for
      a new photo of His Excellency, the President of the United States? Did you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, cut it!&rdquo; said the exasperated Robson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay-ah&rdquo; grunted Galpin, and studied the younger man. &ldquo;Sore?&rdquo; he inquired
      carelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little, I guess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like to kick a hole in The Record shop, and walk haughtily out through
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way I felt yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Want a job on The Guardian?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could you get me on?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can <i>take</i> you on. Beginning Monday, I&rsquo;m city editor. I could use
      one guy that can write.&rdquo; He glanced again at the killed proof, before
      folding it to return to its owner. A thought struck the reporter. &ldquo;Will
      you print this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord; no!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Guardian would n&rsquo;t be any more independent or any less timid about
      this than The Record?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a bit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why do you advise me to change?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you offered&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop right there while you&rsquo;re still on the track. I offered. I did n&rsquo;t
      advise. If you&rsquo;re in this business to write what you want, and to hell
      with the public, I&rsquo;ve got just one piece of advice for you. Turn
      millionaire and get a paper of your own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy flushed. &ldquo;I may do it yet. Not the millionaire part, but the
      other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me a job, then,&rdquo; said the other good-humoredly, &ldquo;as you won&rsquo;t take
      one from me. If you should want it, it&rsquo;s twenty a week to start. Not bad
      for a town of 70,000, Bo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Record&rsquo;s promised me better. I guess I&rsquo;ll stay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay-ah.&rdquo; Galpin accepted the decision indifferently. &ldquo;Well, I guess you&rsquo;ll
      get somewhere sometime if you don&rsquo;t go bucking your head against stone
      walls. But don&rsquo;t waste your poetic style on patriotic kids who stand nobly
      up in galleries for the honor of the flag.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That kid was a girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I noticed in your story. Think I know her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you?&rdquo; cried the other eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only as far as business requires. She&rsquo;s going to make newspaper copy one
      of these days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only girl intercollegiate athlete in America,&rdquo; replied Galpin in the
      manner of a headline. &ldquo;Trying for the golf-team, and from what I hear,
      liable to make it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At Old Central?&rdquo; asked Robson, using the local name for the State
      University of Centralia, on the outskirts of Fenchester.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay-ah,&rdquo; assented Galpin. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a special. Lives down on Montgomery
      Street with old Miss Pritchard.&rdquo; His companion made a mental note of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were n&rsquo;t you a golf-sharp in Kirk College?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captained the team.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if you really want to write a story about Miss Marcia Ames, watch
      out for the team trials next month. The Record&rsquo;ll print that all right.
      Ay-ah,&rdquo; he added reflectively. &ldquo;And there&rsquo;ll be no spiking of the story by
      Mart Embree, either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Senator Embree?&rdquo; said Robson, surprised. &ldquo;Where does he come in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did n&rsquo;t happen to see him around The Record office before you went to
      press yesterday, did you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay-ah. Thought he might &rsquo;a&rsquo; dropped in. He made a call on The
      Guardian too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dove-o&rsquo;-peace mission. Wanted to make sure that nothing would get in
      about the &lsquo;Star-Spangled&rsquo; business to stir up ill-feeling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There rose in Jeremy Robson&rsquo;s mind the recollection of Farley&rsquo;s assurance
      to Embree, &ldquo;You can rely on us;&rdquo; which he had not before connected with
      his slain masterpiece. Now he perceived with indignation that it had been
      slaughtered to save a German holiday, at the hands of the Honorable Martin
      Embree.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s the one that put a crimp in my story, is he!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not necessarily,&rdquo; qualified The Guardian man. &ldquo;Probably they would n&rsquo;t
      have run it anyway. But he wanted to be sure. That&rsquo;s Smiling Martin&rsquo;s way.
      You don&rsquo;t catch him missing many tricks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s his interest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just to smooth things over and keep everything lovely. Rasping up the
      comfortable Dutchers would n&rsquo;t do anybody any good, according to his
      figuring, and would only make things unpleasant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A pussyfooter, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you believe it,&rdquo; returned Galpin. &ldquo;Martin Embree will fight and
      fight like the devil when he sees good cause for it. How else do you think
      he could have got where he is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; retorted the younger man sullenly. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t see where
      he comes in to interfere with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will. Where can I find him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As quick as all that!&rdquo; commented The Guardian reporter. He noted a
      hardening of the small muscles at the corner of Robson&rsquo;s mouth. &ldquo;Scrappy
      little feller, ain&rsquo;t you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; said Jeremy Robson, with his sudden, pleasant grin. &ldquo;I get what
      you mean. Don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m going to make a fool of myself. Just the same I
      <i>will</i> ask him, if you&rsquo;ll tell me where I can catch him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&rsquo;Round at Trask&rsquo;s boarding-house, after dinner, most likely.
      That&rsquo;s where he lives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At Trask&rsquo;s that evening Jeremy Robson ascended through a clinging aroma of
      cookery, to a third-floor room, very tiny, very tidy, very much
      overcrowded with books, pamphlets, a cot, and the spare squareness of the
      Honorable Martin Embree. The visitor was somewhat surprised at finding a
      political leader of such prominence so frugally housed. Embree sat at a
      small table, making notes from a federal report on railroad earnings. He
      lifted his head and Robson noted a single splash of gray in the brown hair
      that waved luxuriantly up from the broad forehead. His meetings with the
      Northern Tier leader had been casual: so he had been the more flattered at
      Embree&rsquo;s ready recognition on the previous evening. Now he was struck anew
      with the soft, almost womanish brilliance of the prominent eyes, and the
      sense of power in the upper part of the face, sharpening down into
      shrewdness, in the mouth and chin. A thoroughly attractive face, and more
      than that, a winning as well as an impressive personality. Embree smiled
      as he greeted his caller by name, and the reporter suddenly felt all the
      animus ooze from his purpose. He still wanted to know the why and
      wherefore of Embree&rsquo;s action. But his interest in knowing was equally
      apportioned between himself and his adversary. Characteristically, Jeremy
      went straight to the point.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came to find out why you got The Record to kill my story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down.&rdquo; The Senator relinquished his chair, motioned his visitor to
      it, and seated himself on the edge of the cot. &ldquo;Your story? What story was
      that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, about the band playing &lsquo;The Star-Spangled Banner&rsquo; and Miss &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
      and just two people standing up for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it your story? I&rsquo;m sorry if it was killed.&rdquo; Embree&rsquo;s tone was of the
      simplest sincerity. &ldquo;But it really was n&rsquo;t my doing. I only suggested to
      Mr. Farley that a mishandling of the episode might create an unfortunate
      impression and incidentally reflect upon The Record. You know how
      sensitive our German-Americans are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;d be better for us if we American-Americans were a little more
      sensitive,&rdquo; blurted Robson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re wholly right, Mr. Robson. I wish more of us had the spirit of that
      young lady in the gallery. What a gallant little figure she was; something
      knightly and valorous about her! And she, all alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was Mr. Laurens,&rdquo; suggested Robson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite another matter. For political effect only, and not in the best of
      taste, I thought. If the chairman had n&rsquo;t been a numskull he would have
      called the whole audience to its feet, and the matter would have been a
      graceful and pleasant and patriotic incident. But Felder is a blunderhead.
      He stopped the music. I would have got the people up, myself, in another
      two seconds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Senator, you understand the Germans,&rdquo; said the reporter, reverting to his
      central interest. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like you to read this and tell me if it would have
      given offense to any decently loyal German-American.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Martin Embree took the proofs, and leaned forward under the lamp to read
      them. What Andrew Galpin had absorbed, almost in a glance, the politician
      plodded through with exasperating slowness. Impatience gave way to
      interest in the reporter&rsquo;s mind, however, when he perceived that his
      reader was perusing the galley a second time over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he inquired, as Embree raised his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Senator&rsquo;s fine smile enveloped him. &ldquo;Frankly, it would n&rsquo;t do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too much fervor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s American fervor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True. But it&rsquo;s exclusively American. &lsquo;All the rest of you not born
      Americans, be damned!&rsquo; It&rsquo;s&mdash;well&mdash;uncharitable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The writer&rsquo;s color deepened. &ldquo;You mean it&rsquo;s unfair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not intentionally. But there are phrases in there that sneer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They could be edited out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so easily. I don&rsquo;t think your writing would be easy to edit, Mr.
      Robson. It hangs together pretty tight. But, so far as this is concerned,
      I can plead &lsquo;Not guilty&rsquo; to being an accomplice. I&rsquo;m sure Mr. Farley would
      never have let it get into print.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was all set up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But not OK&rsquo;d, I assume. You see, Mr. Robson, one must live among our
      Germans to understand them. They&rsquo;re the best people in the world and the
      highest-minded citizens. Germany is n&rsquo;t a nation to them. It&rsquo;s a
      sentiment. It&rsquo;s El Dorado. It&rsquo;s music and poetry and art and literature&mdash;and
      a fairy-land. Lay a profane hand on it, and they&rsquo;re as sensitive as
      children, and as sulky. But at heart they&rsquo;re just as sound Americans as
      you or I, and in politics they&rsquo;re always for the right and clean and
      progressive thing. All they need is to be humored in their harmless and
      rather silly sentimentalism. You see, I&rsquo;m talking to you quite frankly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I appreciate it, Senator.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I appreciate having seen this.&rdquo; Embree tapped the proof with the
      back of his finger. &ldquo;Apart from the substance of it, I&rsquo;m interested. I&rsquo;m
      mightily interested.&rdquo; Jeremy Robson met his direct, intent gaze and
      waited. &ldquo;If I know anything about writing, you can write. There&rsquo;s stuff in
      this. It&rsquo;s a real picture. Perhaps there was a touch of inspiration, too.&rdquo;
       His face became sunny again with its conquering smile. &ldquo;Did you know Miss
      Ames?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not before the interview with her.&rdquo; To his annoyance Jeremy Robson felt
      his face grow hot. Had he written <i>that</i> between the lines, too?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No? A gallant figure. Young America; the imperishable spirit. Do you
      think you could write like that&mdash;without special inspiration?&rdquo; he
      demanded abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the best story I&rsquo;ve done yet. But I can beat it, when I&rsquo;ve had more
      experience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then this town is going to be too small for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no tone of patronage or flattery in the rich, even voice. &ldquo;Were
      you thinking of staying here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Until I learn the ropes. I want to own a pa&mdash;&rdquo; Jeremy Robson stopped
      short. Why should he be confiding his ambitions to this stranger, to whom
      he owed nothing, unless an injury?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A paper of your own,&rdquo; concluded Embree. He fell thoughtful. &ldquo;Ever write
      any editorials?&rdquo; he asked presently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you try it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I never thought of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think of it now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reporters aren&rsquo;t supposed to go outside their own department.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pshaw! A newspaper is like any other business; it needs all the ability
      it can command. Now, I believe you could write editorials. And if you care
      to try, I&rsquo;ll be glad to speak a word to Mr. Farley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s mighty good of you, Senator.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all. Gives me a chance to set myself right in your mind,&rdquo; smiled
      the other, &ldquo;for appearing to interfere with your activities. We need a new
      paper, a new kind of paper here in the capital,&rdquo; he added after another of
      his pauses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy Robson became uncomfortable. &ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;ve been talking through my
      hat,&rdquo; he confessed. &ldquo;It must take a lot of capital to buy a newspaper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so much, for a small-city plant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More than I&rsquo;ll ever see, though.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the right man came to light and proved himself, he might find backing.
      That&rsquo;s why I take an interest in the local newspaper situation. It&rsquo;s only
      a question of the right man. We&rsquo;re looking for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to be that man,&rdquo; blurted the caller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But <i>are</i> you? That&rsquo;s the question.&rdquo; The Senator&rsquo;s fine eyes
      twinkled. But his tone was serious enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How should I know, myself? I&rsquo;ve only had a few months&rsquo; experience. Unless
      you count college journalism.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do,&rdquo; answered the other unexpectedly. &ldquo;A client of mine is a trustee of
      Kirk College. I had occasion to follow the Kirk-Bell&rsquo;s attacks on the
      Board in the intercollegiate football mix-up. You were editing The Bell, I
      believe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; admitted Robson. &ldquo;I guess we were a pretty brash lot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All of that. And you were quite wrong. But you were fighting for what you
      thought a principle, and I liked the way you fought.&rdquo; He put up a large,
      well-kempt hand and pushed a wave of hair back from his forehead. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
      fighting for a principle here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Political?&rdquo; said Jeremy Robson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do politics interest you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They make me sick,&rdquo; returned the reporter vigorously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s bad. Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because of the cheap skates and dumheads I run into whenever I get a
      legislative job.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On behalf of myself and my colleagues, I thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy Robson blushed. &ldquo;Well, you know I don&rsquo;t mean you, Senator.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Possibly some of my associates are shrewder than you give them credit for
      being. But the State Legislature is n&rsquo;t politics. It&rsquo;s only the sieve
      through which politics pass. If you&rsquo;re not interested in politics, the
      newspaper business is n&rsquo;t your line.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did n&rsquo;t say I was n&rsquo;t interested in politics.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True enough. You did n&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Embree shot one of his reckoning glances at
      the young fellow. &ldquo;Well, if you can prove yourself&mdash;if you can fight
      as well as you write and write as hard as you fight&mdash;you&rsquo;re going to
      be worth keeping an eye on. And I&rsquo;m going to keep an eye on you for my own
      reasons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll remember that,&rdquo; said the reporter, rising, &ldquo;when I come to try my
      hand at editorial writing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down. Unless you&rsquo;ve got some engagement.&rdquo; Jeremy shook his head. &ldquo;I
      want to talk to you a little more.&rdquo; Another of those pauses, which gave
      the effect of being filled with considered thinking. &ldquo;About myself,&rdquo;
       finished the Honorable Martin Embree.
    </p>
    <p>
      The visitor resumed his seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you read your own paper?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every word of it, every day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you see an occasional editorial about your humble servant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Jeremy began to feel uncomfortable. The Record&rsquo;s editorial attitude
      toward the Honorable Martin Embree was, to put it mildly, unsympathetic.
      &ldquo;I was surprised to see you in the office,&rdquo; he added bluntly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you think I was as thin-skinned as that?&rdquo; Embree&rsquo;s smile was
      good-humor itself. &ldquo;Politically, Farley is my enemy. Personally, we get
      along pleasantly. In his heart he knows I&rsquo;m right,&rdquo; announced the Senator
      from the Northern Tier, with calm assurance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why does n&rsquo;t he say so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s only a hired man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s editor-in-chief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By title. The real boss is Clarence Ensign.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy stared. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s that? I thought Mr. Ensign was nothing but a
      traveling millionaire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So he is, mostly. But he owns the controlling interest in The Record.
      Absentee landlordism. It&rsquo;s worse in a newspaper than in a mill, because a
      newspaper is supposed to be representative of its public. Ensign&rsquo;s
      newspaper represents only the investments which let him sport around the
      fashionable seaside places in his yacht. Because I&rsquo;m after some of the big
      interests that pay his graft-money, The Record is after me. It&rsquo;s all part
      of the game.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the politician proceeded to amplify on his theme, Jeremy Robson became
      thoughtful. &ldquo;See here, Senator,&rdquo; he said at length, &ldquo;suppose I should
      &lsquo;prove up,&rsquo; as you say, and should get backing for a paper, I&rsquo;d be just a
      hired man for my backers, would n&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not if you were strong enough to make yourself the necessary part of the
      paper. But you&rsquo;d have to believe in the policies of your backers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe I could believe in anything I had to believe in,&rdquo;
       returned Jeremy quaintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Correct answer,&rdquo; approved Embree with emphasis. &ldquo;No fellow could that&rsquo;s
      worth his salt. Anyway, it does n&rsquo;t so much matter, provided you believe
      in something and stick to your belief instead of singing whatever tune
      you&rsquo;re paid or ordered to sing.&rdquo; Again, one of his frequent pauses. &ldquo;Like
      The Record and The Guardian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Guardian, too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s worse. The Record at least represents its own interests, even
      if they are pretty sordid. The Guardian is anybody&rsquo;s hired man. Do you
      know Wymett, the editor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a crook.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a short and ugly word, Senator.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wymett&rsquo;s a short and ugly animile. Short on payment of his obligations,
      and ugly in a fight because you never know who he&rsquo;s sold to last. Though,
      at that&rdquo;&mdash;and here the considering pause came in the middle of the
      statement&mdash;&ldquo;you can be pretty sure that Montrose Clark will have the
      deciding word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that the President of the Public Utilities Corporation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the man. Know him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve reported him at meetings, twice. He did n&rsquo;t say anything much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He never does, in public or for the public. What did you think of him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought he was a pompous little stuffed shirt,&rdquo; was the reporter&rsquo;s
      irreverent opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s pompous enough. But there&rsquo;s brains behind those piggy eyes of his.
      We were talking of politics. Well, Montrose Clark <i>is</i> politics. He&rsquo;s
      politics, big.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would have thought he was finance, and bluff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Finance, of course. That is politics. Let me give you a one-minute
      synopsis of the politics of this State. I told you the Legislature was a
      sieve. Well, the men that feed and shake the sieve are the financial and
      public utility interests; Montrose Clark representing the traction crowd,
      Magnus Laurens representing the water-power grabbers, Robert Wanser
      representing the banks, Sam Corliess representing the lake shipping,
      Selden Dana representing the railroads, and so on. And our newspapers are
      mostly just their little yellow dogs, useful to help put over their deals
      and to fool the people. What we need, and we need it right here in the
      capital, is a newspaper that will tell the people, not fool them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s &lsquo;we&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Senator&rsquo;s earnest gaze flickered for a moment. &ldquo;I,&rdquo; he said, at
      length. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m making this fight pretty near alone so far.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What fight is that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fight to get the control of the State away from the grafters and
      exploiters and turn it over to the people. And I&rsquo;m beginning to get the
      support I need now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From the German crowd?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Senator smiled at his caller with an expression almost affectionate.
      &ldquo;You would n&rsquo;t take to politics much worse than a duck to water. Yes; from
      the Germans largely. I&rsquo;m a reformer, and I&rsquo;m not ashamed of the name. The
      German-Americans are solid for reform and clean government. Government by
      corporations is never clean. It can&rsquo;t be. It uses the kind of tools that
      Wymett is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Guardian has offered me a job,&rdquo; observed Jeremy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t touch it,&rdquo; advised the other earnestly. &ldquo;They &rsquo;re on the
      ragged edge. As I told you, Wymett is a crook. One of these days I&rsquo;m going
      to tell the State that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe I&rsquo;ll be there to report it,&rdquo; said the caller, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;ll be there (you should work into the legislative end, by the
      way, for the experience); but you won&rsquo;t report it. Your paper would print
      any attack by Wymett on me that suited its purposes. But if I proved
      Wymett to be a crook and a grafter&mdash;not a word in The Record. That&rsquo;s
      the way the papers hang together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; returned Jeremy stoutly. &ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t
      newspaper men stand together? Politicians do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You feel that way about it?&rdquo; The Senator&rsquo;s tone was colder. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a
      question of fair play. However&rdquo;&mdash;the sunny smile returned to his face&mdash;&ldquo;we&rsquo;ve
      had a pretty straight talk, and I hope I&rsquo;ve given you something to carry
      away with you. I&rsquo;ll admit my object is largely selfish. I&rsquo;m looking
      everywhere for the man who can eventually make a newspaper for the public.
      It won&rsquo;t come tomorrow, or next day. But it&rsquo;ll come some day. It&rsquo;s got to.
      And don&rsquo;t forget that editorial writing. Make it mild, at first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before he went to bed that night, Jeremy Robson had sketched out three
      editorials. For a week he re-wrote and re-cast and polished them. To his
      keen satisfaction, two of them were accepted. The third, which touched
      upon the &ldquo;Star-Spangled Banner&rdquo; episode, most tactfully and in what the
      writer deemed to be the broadest and most charitable spirit, was turned
      down. Farley encouraged him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep it up, Robson. As soon as you&rsquo;ve learned our ways you&rsquo;ll fit into
      the page.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER III
    </h2>
    <p class="indent20">
      &ldquo;Oh, happier he who gains not
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      The Love some seem to gain:
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      The joy that custom stains not
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Shall still with him remain.
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      The loveliness that wanes not,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      The Love that ne&rsquo;er can wane.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE soft, young
      contralto voice floating out from the old house on Montgomery Street,
      mingled with the breath of roses that spread possessively over the
      veranda. A ripple of sparkling chords, like wind passing over water, died
      away in a delicate and plaintive minor cadence. A light footstep moved
      within the house. The voice, now not more than a clear murmur, hummed in
      the hallway. Something told the listener and lurker on the sidewalk that
      it were advisable he should be on his way. To be caught staring, gawking
      and explanationless, before the Wondrous Maiden&rsquo;s domicile is not the
      happiest method of producing a favorable impression upon the Wondrous
      Maiden, which latter was become the immediate and predominant purpose of
      young Mr. Jeremy Robson&rsquo;s existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      He passed on. After a score or more of paces he began to lag and waver.
      Yet an undue hesitancy of spirit had never been reckonable as among young
      Mr. Robson&rsquo;s major failings. He had come along Montgomery Street, which is
      a free public thoroughfare wherein any and all may pass, without let or
      hindrance, upon their lawful occasions, a youth upright and secure of
      himself. Nothing more formidable had marked his itinerary than a
      singularly sweet young voice, singing to an unknown measure the words of
      Mr. Andrew Lang&rsquo;s haunting and wistful lyric. Yet young Mr. Robson became
      instantly aware of strange symptoms within himself. His pulse was markedly
      uneven. His eyes were affected by a spasmodic inclination which all but
      twisted his neck about in the opposite direction to that of his reluctant
      steps. His mind was a kingdom divided against itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrived at the corner he found himself racked by conflicting muscular
      intentions and inhibitions. He turned into Nicklin Avenue, leading
      downtown to his proper occupation, and almost immediately executed a
      rightabout-face. He returned to the corner, and rebounded from the impact
      of an unreasoning and unmanning fear. Again he retraced his steps and
      halted. His feet gave him the painful impression of a divided allegiance,
      and he recognized and resented the invalidity of the poet's praise of
      those supposedly useful members:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &ldquo;I only have to steer &rsquo;em, and
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      They ride me everywheres.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the midst of his confusion he became hotly aware of the surprised
      scrutiny of a small boy with a dog.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lost somethin&rsquo;?&rdquo; inquired the small boy, scornfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy Robson started. Was the urchin possessed of the spirit of
      divination? Certainly young Mr. Robson had lost his nerve. That much he
      confessed to himself. The small boy&rsquo;s dog divined the fact also. He made a
      charge upon the wavering youth with the evident intention of chasing him
      up a tree. To be flouted in the open day by a cur of highly impeachable
      antecedents was a little too much!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get out!&rdquo; commanded Jeremy Robson, in a tone which left no room for
      doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      The small boy and his dog retired hastily. Their intended victim, somewhat
      reconstituted in soul by the victory, clinched his final decision, not
      indeed without a sinking of the breath, and with a firm tread and an
      unwavering eye (as he had once written of an unfortunate going to his
      execution) again plunged into the imminent, deadly breach of Montgomery
      Street, and headed for the old house amid the roses. He reckoned that she
      would be just about on the porch now. If she were n&rsquo;t, he would go on past
      and make for the office, and try again on the morrow. If she were&mdash;well,
      he had recovered command of at least three matured and plausible lies to
      explain his presence. Then he saw her, and the lies forsook and left him
      stranded with nothing better than the truth to tell, if the issue rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was standing at the top of the five veranda steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      An errant wind weaving among the roses above her, let through swift glints
      of sunlight, which played upon her face and hair with fairy touches. There
      was a dreamy and wistful smile, as in lingering memory of the music she
      had sung, upon her lips. Her face, broad at the temples and narrowing down
      to a small, self-willed chin, was modeled nearer upon the sensitive and
      changeful lines of the triangle than upon the cold and classic oval. Above
      it the splendid mass of tawny hair was hardly kept respectably within
      bounds by the prisoning devices of net and band. She was slender, and
      firm-set, and straight with the soft and strong lines of young, untainted
      health and vigor. By the warm hues, and the lithe poise of her, she was a
      creature bred in the happy usages of sunlight and free winds and the open
      spaces. Again he felt in her that subtle, disturbing, starry quality that
      makes for dreams.
    </p>
    <p>
      In her hand she swung a broad sun-hat. Reluctantly she lifted her arms to
      set it on her head. The pulses of Jeremy Robson made a bound of
      hopefulness. Evidently she was coming out upon the street. Her eyes were
      lifted and he wondered that he could ever have thought them gray, so
      flooded were they with hazel lights as they met the radiance, sifting down
      through the trees. She turned them upon him and a slow recognition grew in
      them. Opening the gate, she stood waiting. He lifted his hat as he
      approached.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-morning,&rdquo; she greeted him in that voice which, with its indefinable
      distinction of accent, had thrilled in his memory, since he had first
      heard her speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      He returned her greeting, calling her by name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is The Record you write for, is it not?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Yes. But they
      don&rsquo;t print all I write.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I infer,&rdquo; she returned with grave and intent eyes. &ldquo;Were you
      disappointed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I supposed that you had made up your mind that it was not worth writing
      after all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was worth writing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But not worth printing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Worth printing, too. But the editors were afraid of offending the
      Germans. So they killed it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you write it in that way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To offend the Germans.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I wrote it to show that there was a place for Americanism even in a
      German meeting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad you did that,&rdquo; she said quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve a right to be. You&rsquo;re responsible. For the way I wrote it, I mean.
      You gave me the notion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad of that, too. But I am sorrier than ever that I did not see
      your article.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I&rsquo;ll show it to you some day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She nodded, without asking him how or where. Marcia Ames was one of those
      individuals who wait unquestioningly and accept generously. &ldquo;It is quite a
      coincidence my meeting you here,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;For I wished to ask you about
      the article.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Behold the path now made plain for the lurker and retracer of steps! No
      need even for those well-formulated lies; he could simply accept the
      theory of coincidence. And, most unaccountably, he found that he could
      n&rsquo;t. Perhaps he could have, had he not looked into her eyes just then.
      That steady, limpid, candid, confident regard of hers forbade even a petty
      and harmless deceit of convenience. Once for all Jeremy Robson knew that
      whatever might be between them in future, there would at least be truth.
      And with a sharp pang, felt the foreboding that the truth might yet hurt
      him to the limit of his capacity for pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he denied. &ldquo;No coincidence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not?&rdquo; she asked, surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve passed here every day for the last ten days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you live on this block?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. In the other end of town, up near the University.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you would not pass here to go to The Record office.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your geography is unimpeachable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it a riddle? I am not at all clever at them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a confession. I&rsquo;ve been coming this way day after day for a
      particular purpose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To see you again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you wish to see me about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing. Nothing in particular.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just to see me? That is very nice of you.&rdquo; She studied him with her
      direct and serene regard. But a small and willful dimple materialized on
      the brown curve of her cheek, and a little one-sided smile went up to meet
      it. &ldquo;Not as a reporter this time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in the least. A reporter may be just an ordinary human being, off
      duty, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you just an ordinary human being?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very much so. Don&rsquo;t I strike you that way?&rdquo; His tone was one of
      exaggerated anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl studied him with impersonal interest, quite free from
      embarrassment. Magnus Laurens had credited him with good looks. In the
      usual sense, Miss Ames decided, confirming her first opinion, he was not
      entitled to this credit. He was rather rugged of build and face, with
      mobile lips, boyish and pleasant eyes, an obstinate jaw which looked as if
      it might set to courage and endurance or perhaps to sullenness, and the
      expression and bearing of one vividly and intelligently curious about the
      life-scheme of which he was a part. The girl noted, with approval, his
      dress: quietly harmonious in every detail yet without suggesting the
      finicky habit; a style which would have been unremarkable in New York or
      London, but which stood out with a pleasant distinction among the more
      casual and careless garb of the Middle West.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really had not given it much thought,&rdquo; she answered, having completed
      her scrutiny. &ldquo;Your methods seem rather out of the ordinary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you a million years old?&rdquo; he asked abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      If his intention was to startle her, it failed signally. &ldquo;Surely that is a
      very personal question. I am not&mdash;quite. Why do you ask?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because you look so like a kid and yet you&rsquo;ve got the nerve&mdash;no, not
      nerve&mdash;the confidence and manner of your own great-grandmother. It&rsquo;s
      very confusing,&rdquo; complained young Mr. Robson, leaning dejectedly upon the
      gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps it arrives from my having been brought up abroad and much among
      older people,&rdquo; she surmised, with one of her slightly un-English turns of
      phrase. &ldquo;One reason for my coming here to the University is to accustom
      myself to your American ways.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;<i>Your</i>&rsquo; American ways?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our American ways,&rdquo; she amended sweetly. &ldquo;Oh, I am all American in my
      heart!&rdquo; The gay and willful little dimple again materialized on her cheek.
      &ldquo;Still, one cannot remain indefinitely leaning over a gate in
      conversation, however thrilling, with a young man whose name one does not
      even know, can one?&rdquo; she pointed out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know my name?&rdquo; Young Mr. Robson looked distinctly annoyed. &ldquo;Mr.
      Laurens presented me. Don&rsquo;t you remember?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you were only a reporter who was going to write something about me,
      then.&rdquo; With an emphasis on the final word, slight, indeed, yet amply
      sufficient to make amends.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her caller brightened perceptibly. &ldquo;Surname Robson. Given name, Jeremy.
      Jem, when you get to know me better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She opened her eyes very wide to take in this idea. &ldquo;You expect that we
      are going to know each other so well as that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We certainly are if I can bring it about. Don&rsquo;t you think I&rsquo;ve made a
      good start?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At least a quick one. What is your next step?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s worrying me a little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But so progressing a young man as you, with so much perseverance,&rdquo; she
      taunted, &ldquo;surely if you planned to see me once, you would plan how to see
      me again. Perhaps, though, you do not wish to see me again soon,&rdquo; she
      added, with an adorable mock-melancholy droop of the alluring lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never win any guessing contests on that form, Miss Ames,&rdquo; he
      assured her, shaking his head solemnly. &ldquo;But you&rsquo;re right enough about my
      having a plan. The question is, will it work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Try it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here goes. You&rsquo;re trying for the Varsity golf team, are n&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I intend to, if I improve enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you pretty good?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am steady. Only twice I have been as high as one hundred. But my short
      approaches are bad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can help &rsquo;em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you? Are you a good player?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fair. But I&rsquo;ll tell you what I am. I&rsquo;m a good coach. We never lost an
      intercollegiate at Kirk in the three years I captained the team.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you offer to coach me? It is very kind of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait. It may not be so simple as all that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall you exact terms?&rdquo; she smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This depends on how much you are in earnest about making the team.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough to get up at five in the morning and play a round?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why such an unearthly hour?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about the only time I can be sure of. Don&rsquo;t forget I&rsquo;m a
      hard-working reporter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you wished me to forget it, only a moment ago,&rdquo; she teased.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want you to remember that I&rsquo;m a man,&rdquo; he retorted, &ldquo;besides being a
      reporter. And that you and I are going to be friends.&rdquo; He looked her
      fairly in the eyes. &ldquo;At least,&rdquo; he added quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The baffling lights in her eyes deepened as she met his gaze,
      unwaveringly. &ldquo;I believe that we are&mdash;at least,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;When
      shall we begin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We <i>have</i> begun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The golf, I mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed outright. &ldquo;You lose no time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that I have any to lose. I don&rsquo;t know how long you&rsquo;re to be
      here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor do I,&rdquo; she answered with a sudden gravity. &ldquo;Very well; to-morrow. I
      will meet you at the club house at 5.45. Oh! I forgot. My golf shoes are
      at Eli Wade&rsquo;s. You remember; the &lsquo;Boot &amp; Shoe Surgeon&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get them this afternoon, and bring them with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Lo, Miss Marcy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The interruption, in a cheerful sing-song, came from behind Jeremy. He
      turned to face the small boy and the dog of his earlier encounter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-morning, Buddy,&rdquo; returned the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come to weed the sparr&rsquo;grass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes: we have been expecting you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I stopped by home to get you these.&rdquo; He brought out a fistful of
      deep-hearted pansies, bound in a pink string.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl took them, gave him a little, quick pat of the hand which he
      accepted with a flush of mingled adoration and embarrassment, and pinned
      them at her throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is Mr. Burton Higman,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Mr. Jeremy Robson. To his friends,
      Jem, and Mr. Higman to his friends, Buddy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Higman regarded Mr. Robson with a consideration in which there was
      more of suspicion than friendliness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where &rsquo;dje gittim?&rdquo; he demanded of Miss Ames.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not get him. He came,&rdquo; explained the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yep. I seen him before he got here. He was down on the corner, actin&rsquo;
      queer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold on, now, Buddy,&rdquo; protested the other, looking pained. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t take
      away a man&rsquo;s character.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Ames motioned him to silence, and turned an eye of lively
      anticipation upon the urchin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was he doing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Snake-turns. Walk down Nicklin Avenya; turn. Walk up to the corner; turn
      again. Stop at the corner; talk to a tree. Walk down Nicklin Avenya again;
      turn oncet more. Stand still. I watcht him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did he do then?&rdquo; asked the girl, enjoying the discomfiture of her
      caller.
    </p>
    <p>
      The narrator rubbed one foot over the other and considered. &ldquo;Sweat,&rdquo; he
      stated conscientiously. &ldquo;Look at his collar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Robson&rsquo;s involuntary hand and Miss Ames&rsquo; involuntary gaze met upon the
      article of apparel indicated. It melted under the double pressure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Walked back up to Montgomery Street,&rdquo; continued the conscientious
      chronicler en joyably. &ldquo;Stopped. Cussed the tree. Sweat some more. Turned
      down Bank&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will do, Buddy. You should be a detective.&rdquo; Mr. Burton Higman
      blushed in glory. The girl turned to the accused. &ldquo;Is all this true?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guilty as charged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any mitigating circumstances?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was screwing up my courage to face an ordeal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s an ordeal?&rdquo; demanded the watchful Mr. Higman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am,&rdquo; replied Miss Ames.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yep: I&rsquo;m on,&rdquo; observed her youthful admirer, enlightened. &ldquo;Mr. Wade on
      the School Board made us a talk Sat&rsquo;day, about ordeals. Said each one of
      us should adopt a high ordeal and stick to it. If you&rsquo;re one, and I got to
      do it, I choose to adopt you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Buddy,&rdquo; said his rival.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yep?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you sell out your claim for a dime?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, <i>sir!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For a quarter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Foradol&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quit! No fair!&rdquo; protested Mr. Higman in a voice of poignant agony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right. It is n&rsquo;t fair. Shake, old boy.&rdquo; Young Mr. Robson gravely
      shook young Burton Higman by the hand. &ldquo;Between you and me, only honorable
      and knightly rivalry. We&rsquo;ll go fishing some day and talk over high ordeals
      and other matters close to the heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And at present Buddy and I will map out the attack upon the asparagus,&rdquo;
       said the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned away, with a smile of dismissal for her informal caller.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he took himself off, Marcia Ames turned to her other admirer. &ldquo;Well,
      Buddy. What do you think of him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a nut,&rdquo; was the prompt and uncompromising decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So bad? If it is bad. What is a nut?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Plumb crazy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think so? Perhaps, a little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Plumb!&rdquo; persisted the other jealously. But the innate and responsive
      fair-mindedness of youth prompted him to add: &ldquo;But, say! When he kinda
      smiles that way at ye, it&rsquo;s all off. There&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo; to it. It gets you.
      Ain&rsquo;t it true?&rdquo; inquired Buddy earnestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The unanalytical Buddy was flattered, thrilled, and faintly puzzled by the
      instant response to this speech when, laughing, his goddess caught him in
      a quick, warm little hug. He did n&rsquo;t wholly understand why she did it.
    </p>
    <p>
      For that matter, neither did she.
    </p>

      CHAPTER IV
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">G</span>OLF boots?&rdquo; said
      Eli Wade, Boot &amp; Shoe Surgeon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fer the young lady at Miss Pritchard&rsquo;s? Right here.&rdquo; He held them up to
      his own admiration. &ldquo;A foot that&rsquo;s <i>right</i>&rdquo; said the Boot &amp; Shoe
      Surgeon. &ldquo;Right <i>and</i> light. Honest wear on them boots. Even as a
      die. No sloppy, slovenly running down at one side of the heel. The wearer
      of them boots carries her weight square an&rsquo; level, she does. She stands
      straight an&rsquo; she walks straight. Yes, an&rsquo; she talks you straight, an&rsquo;
      looks you straight in the eye. Why did n&rsquo;t she come for &rsquo;em
      herself, same as she brung &rsquo;em? Not ailin&rsquo;, is she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was going by this way, so I stopped in to save time,&rdquo; said Jeremy
      Robson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome. But I&rsquo;d ruther she&rsquo;d come, herself. We had a good talk,
      her an&rsquo; me, when she brung in the boots.&rdquo; He wrapped them up clumsily but
      carefully. &ldquo;A good operation,&rdquo; stated the Boot &amp; Shoe Surgeon. &ldquo;An <i>extry</i>
      good operation. But no extry charge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A figure stirred in a long canvas chair in the corner. From it came a
      mutter in which the words &ldquo;Scab-work&rdquo; in a contemptuous tone were alone
      comprehensible. The figure reared a white-thatched head, and a keen, lined
      face, above a sinewy neck set upon a spare frame. &ldquo;Rich, ain&rsquo;t she?&rdquo; said
      the figure. &ldquo;Let her pay extry, then, for extry work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rich she may or may not be,&rdquo; replied the Boot &amp; Shoe Surgeon. &ldquo;Proud
      she ain&rsquo;t. Comes in here as free as fresh air an&rsquo; as pleasant. &lsquo;Mr. Wade?&rsquo;
      s&rsquo; she. &lsquo;Doctor Wade, when I&rsquo;m in the Surgery, Miss,&rsquo; s&rsquo; I. &lsquo;Doctor Wade,
      you get my trade,&rsquo; s&rsquo; she, and laughed a little, for she had n&rsquo;t meant to
      say it that way. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s as purty a rhyme as ever I heard in my life,
      Miss,&rsquo; s&rsquo; I. I looked at the boots. &lsquo;Furrin?&rsquo; s&rsquo; I. &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; s&rsquo; she. I
      looked up at her. &lsquo;Furrin?&rsquo; s&rsquo; I. &lsquo;No,&rsquo; s&rsquo; she. &lsquo;American,&rsquo; s&rsquo; she. &lsquo;As
      American as you are.&rsquo; &lsquo;Glad to hear it,&rsquo; s&rsquo; I. &lsquo;You must be an American
      from &rsquo;way-back,&rsquo; s&rsquo; I, &lsquo;fer the Wades f&rsquo;m Wal-<i>tham</i>? s&rsquo; I,
      &lsquo;have fit in every war f&rsquo;m the Revolution sence, all an&rsquo; inclusive, an&rsquo; I
      reckon to live to fight in the comin&rsquo; one, ef they take &rsquo;em over
      sixty years of age,&rsquo; s&rsquo; I. &lsquo;What is the comin&rsquo; one, Doctor Wade?&rsquo; s&rsquo; she.
      &lsquo;Why, the war when us Americans has got to get together and fight for
      Americar against all these durn fur-riners that think they own the earth,&rsquo;
      s&rsquo; I. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s the comin&rsquo; war as I reckon it, an&rsquo; I guess it&rsquo;s comin&rsquo; right
      here in Centralia an&rsquo; through the Middle West purty soon unless we figger
      to let ourselves get shewed plum off the map,&rsquo; s&rsquo; I. Then she told me
      about noticin&rsquo; the flag an&rsquo; the motter in my winder, an&rsquo; says that&rsquo;s why
      she brung me her trade, an&rsquo; she hopes the flag &rsquo;ll stay there, fer
      trade follers the flag, s&rsquo; she, or ought to in sech a good cause. An&rsquo; she
      laughs that laugh of hern, like music, an&rsquo; we settled down an&rsquo; had a real
      good palaver. So,&rdquo; said the Boot &amp; Shoe Surgeon, &ldquo;she gets a
      low-priced, extry-good operation. Though I&rsquo;m bound to say, she&rsquo;d &rsquo;a&rsquo;
      got somethin&rsquo; extry jest on the straight way she wears shoe-leather.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You read character from shoes, then,&rdquo; commented Jeremy Robson, mildly
      amused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;d I be if I couldn&rsquo;t? A cobbler! A leather-patcher! Not a genuwyne
      Boot &amp; Shoe Surgeon. Character in shoes? Of course there is. Lemme see
      yours.&rdquo; He lifted up first one, then the other foot of his visitor, as if
      he were a horse, and shook his head soberly over them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You stumble,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t struck your gait, yet. Bump up against
      things when there&rsquo;s no sense in it. Foolish. Obstinit, too, I would n&rsquo;t
      wonder. Lazy? M-m-m! I dunno. I guess you like the easy way an&rsquo; a clear
      path pretty good. If you&rsquo;re sensible an&rsquo; saving, better leave them shoes
      with me for a little toning-up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you undertake to improve my character with the improvement to my
      shoes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Laugh at me if you like. You don&rsquo;t laugh at folks that believes in
      palmistry. What&rsquo;s a man&rsquo;s palm to read! He can change every line in it
      with a hoe, or an awl, or a golf-stick. But his shoes! Ah! As a man walks,
      so he is. An&rsquo; his shoes tell the tale. Take these, young man.&rdquo; The Boot
      &amp; Shoe Surgeon laid an affectionate hand upon Miss Marcia Ames&rsquo; boots.
      &ldquo;Study &rsquo;em. They&rsquo;ll repay you. There&rsquo;s courage an&rsquo; clean pride an&rsquo;
      a warm heart that travels the path she walks. Yes; an&rsquo; a touch of vanity&mdash;Why
      not? An&rsquo; a temper of their own, them boots. Hot an&rsquo; quick an&rsquo; generous.
      You&rsquo;ve got to travel some to keep pace with them boots. I dunno when I&rsquo;ve
      had a pair to match &rsquo;em. Here&rsquo;s another pair &rsquo;ll go far.&rdquo; He
      lifted them into view. &ldquo;Hand-made, stout-made, and serviceable. They &rsquo;re
      climbers, they are! They &rsquo;ll reach the high places&mdash;if they
      don&rsquo;t slip.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who owns them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Honorable Martin Embree.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A faker,&rdquo; grunted the white-haired figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A climber. A hustler. A fighter. No faker. Yet&mdash;they may slip,&rdquo; said
      the diagnostician, studying the sole of the left boot. &ldquo;They <i>may</i>
      slip. Gave me some advice, when he saw my winder. &lsquo;Leave the flag, but
      take out the motter,&rsquo; s&rsquo; he. &lsquo;There&rsquo;s no sense in that &ldquo;It stands alone.&rdquo;
       The country is big enough an&rsquo; broad enough for all nationalities, an&rsquo;
      welcome,&rsquo; s&rsquo; he.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sensible enough,&rdquo; growled the figure in the chair. &ldquo;But he&rsquo;s a faker. A
      half-heart. All for the people in words. But put it up to him in deeds&mdash;he
      ain&rsquo;t there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a Socialist,&rdquo; explained the Boot &amp; Shoe Surgeon, pointing his
      awl at the chair. &ldquo;Nicholas Milliken. Make you acquainted. What did you
      say your name was?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jeremy Robson,&rdquo; said its owner, who had n&rsquo;t yet said anything of the
      sort.
    </p>
    <p>
      The figure in the chair for the first time honored him with its attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On The Record?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reporter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ve got the soul of a louse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Soft words, Nick,&rdquo; prescribed Eli Wade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Soft words? Hard facts! The soul of a louse!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who the devil are you?&rdquo; demanded Jeremy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A Socialist,&rdquo; repeated the Boot &amp; Shoe Surgeon. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mind him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Milliken rose and stood before the subject of his com-temptuous phrase;
      long, lean, dry, and bitter. &ldquo;Me?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a man. I&rsquo;m no hired pen.
      I write for The Free-Thinker, when I write.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rest of the time he sets type on The Record,&rdquo; explained Wade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it. Many a time I&rsquo;ve run the stick over your stuff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to have made an unfavorable impression on you,&rdquo; remarked Jeremy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you can write.&rdquo; The other flung the concession to him
      condescendingly. &ldquo;I grant you that. What good does that do you? You&rsquo;ve got
      to trim your facts to your owner&rsquo;s orders, have n&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not facts,&rdquo; denied the reporter with some heat. &ldquo;Facts are facts. I don&rsquo;t
      trim them for anybody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody trims them after they&rsquo;re written, either, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tone was not to Jeremy&rsquo;s liking. &ldquo;The copy-desk&mdash;&rdquo; he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, cut the guff! The copy-desk is a hired blue pencil, just like you&rsquo;re
      a hired pen. You know what I mean. Why did n&rsquo;t they print your story on
      the girl at the Federated German Societies meeting? Was n&rsquo;t it facts? Was
      n&rsquo;t it good enough?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you,&rdquo; resumed the implacable Socialist. &ldquo;They were afraid.
      Afraid of the German crowd. Call their souls their own? Not any more than
      you can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about yourself, Nick?&rdquo; put in the proprietor of the place. &ldquo;You take
      The Record&rsquo;s money, the same as this gentleman, only maybe not so much of
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I sell myself for it? Would I write for The Record? Or any other of
      the capitalistic press? Eli Wade, you&rsquo;re honest, you are. A fool, but
      honest. You don&rsquo;t know what a reporter&rsquo;s got to do to hold his job. Why,
      if you was to get into some mix-up over a pair of shoes with the owner of
      his paper to-morrow, he&rsquo;d be sent down here to write you wrong, whether
      you were right or wrong, and he&rsquo;d do it. He&rsquo;d have to do it. That&rsquo;s what
      comes of a privately owned press, under our capitalistic system.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Through the gross exaggeration Jeremy felt the point of a half-truth and
      resented it. &ldquo;No decent reporter would do it,&rdquo; he asserted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who said anything about &lsquo;decent&rsquo; reporters?&rdquo; countered the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy&rsquo;s face changed; his weight shifted slightly upon his feet. Not so
      slightly but that the pedal diagnostician noticed the movement. &ldquo;Want to
      get your eye punched?&rdquo; he inquired, of Milliken. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going the right
      way for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Socialist grinned wickedly and relishingly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t like that, huh? All
      right. Come to me a year from now and tell me I&rsquo;m wrong, and I&rsquo;ll
      apologize. That&rsquo;s fair. Ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s fair,&rdquo; corroborated the Boot &amp; Shoe Surgeon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mind you,&rdquo; continued the Socialist, pursuing his favorite path of
      self-explication; &ldquo;I would n&rsquo;t ha&rsquo; printed your story, either. It was a
      fool story. Ain&rsquo;t the Germans just as good as we are? Better &rsquo;n a
      lot of us. They believe in the rights o&rsquo; men, they do. None of your dirty
      aristocratic notions about them. Look at Germany! Most Socialistic country
      in the world to-day. Most civilized, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let &rsquo;em stay in their own country, then,&rdquo; said Eli Wade. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t
      want &rsquo;em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, but we do! We need &rsquo;em to help on the Social Revolution.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My folks fit in one American Revolution,&rdquo; said the
    </p>
    <p>
      Doctor stoutly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t reckon none of us is going to fight in another
      led by Germans and crazy folks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll come around,&rdquo; laughed Milliken. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll live to be ashamed of that
      silly motto in your window. Take it out! Take it out, Eli Wade, and put
      the Red Flag of World-Brotherhood in its place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Above the American flag, mebbe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Along with it. My stock&rsquo;s as good Yankee as yours, Eli. But I&rsquo;m ready to
      fight again for libutty, and you ain&rsquo;t. You read too much in the
      capitalistic press. Some day you&rsquo;ll be reading this young feller&rsquo;s
      editorials, all about the rights o&rsquo; capital and what the laboring man owes
      to his employer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will not,&rdquo; said Jeremy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trying your pen at editorials, ain&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you been setting those up, too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly. You&rsquo;ll land. You&rsquo;ve got the knack. The slick, smooth, oily trick
      of making the thing seem what it ain&rsquo;t. So pretty soon I&rsquo;ll have to take
      that back about your having the soul of a louse. You&rsquo;ll be worse than
      that. I&rsquo;ll tell you what you&rsquo;ll be.&rdquo; And he told, naming a very ancient
      and much blown-upon profession.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;ll be enough an&rsquo; some-to-carry from you,&rdquo; said the Boot &amp; Shoe
      Surgeon indignantly. &ldquo;Get out of my place an&rsquo; don&rsquo;t come back until you&rsquo;ve
      cleaned your dirty tongue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Resentment of his brusque dismissal was far remote from Mr. Nicholas
      Milliken&rsquo;s philosophic mind, if one were to judge by the cheerful smile
      with which he rose. &ldquo;All right, old moozle-head!&rdquo; he returned
      affectionately. &ldquo;He fires me about once a week,&rdquo; he explained to Jeremy.
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s when he can&rsquo;t stand any more good, plain facts. They boil over on
      him and out I go, with the steam. Don&rsquo;t you mind me, either, young feller.
      You&rsquo;ll see I&rsquo;m right, one day. We&rsquo;re all bound upon the Wheel of Things,
      as the old Lammy said to Kim. Supprised, are you, that I know Roodyerd
      Kipling?&rdquo; He preened himself with a childish vanity. &ldquo;I read everything!
      The old Lammy was a bit of a Socialist himself. All bound upon the Wheel
      of Things. And if I see a little clearer than you, it&rsquo;s only because I
      happen to be bound a turn or two higher up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The ineffable patronage of this amused Jeremy into good humor. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call
      on you for that apology, though, one of these days,&rdquo; he said to the
      parting guest, Eli Wade looked after Milliken with a frown. &ldquo;Them shoes of
      his have got a gallows gait,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;Lawless paths! Lawless paths!
      Why do I stand his bitter tongue? I guess it&rsquo;s because he makes me think.
      I wish I had his education,&rdquo; sighed the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did he get it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Picked it up. Libraries, night schools, and the like. He was a New
      England mill-hand, always in hot water. Stirrin&rsquo; up labor troubles an&rsquo; all
      that. Picked up typography an&rsquo; drifted out here. A quirky mind an&rsquo; a
      restless one, an&rsquo; a bad course it sets for his feet to follow,&rdquo; said the
      gentle, one-ideaed old philosopher of foot-gear. &ldquo;But not a bad heart,
      Nick has n&rsquo;t. Come in again, young gentleman,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;Not in the way
      of trade. Come in an&rsquo; talk with the old man. One of you newspaper
      gentlemen drops in for a chat, often. Mr. Galpin of The Guardian. You&rsquo;ll
      know him, I guess?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Them are his spare shoes, yonder. Rough, ordinary, plain articles.
      Plodders. But good wearing stuff in &rsquo;em an&rsquo; right solid on the
      ground, every inch. Slow-moving,&rdquo; he nodded thoughtfully. &ldquo;Yes; they&rsquo;ll
      move slow, but they won&rsquo;t never wobble. An&rsquo; don&rsquo;t think to trip up the man
      that walks in &rsquo;em. It ain&rsquo;t to be done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you&rsquo;re right, there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right? Cert&rsquo;nly I&rsquo;m right. Leather never lies. Not good leather. An&rsquo; poor
      leather&rsquo;s a dead give-away. My museum of soles.&rdquo; He waved a showman&rsquo;s hand
      toward the rows of shoes suspended neatly in brackets of his own devising
      against the walls. &ldquo;Look at them Congress gaiters. Would n&rsquo;t you know they
      was a banker&rsquo;s belongings? Robert Wanser, President of the Trust Company.
      Full and easy and comfortable and mebbe a little sly in the gait. But
      there&rsquo;s weight in &rsquo;em. Don&rsquo;t get in their way. There&rsquo;s Rappelje&rsquo;s
      next &rsquo;em; Professor Rappelje, of the University. Queer neighbors.
      Straight and thin and fine finished, his gear. Mebbe a little pinchy. But
      a man to swear by. And Bausch: them high-button calfs. He&rsquo;s a buster.
      Busts his buttons off. One of them big, puffin&rsquo;-up Germans. Always
      marching. Tramp-tramp-tramp: the goose-step. Nothin&rsquo; o&rsquo; that in that lot
      on the end. Judge Dana. See the ball of the soles? Worn down. Creeps, he
      does. Guess he can jump too, after he&rsquo;s crept near enough. An&rsquo; that pair
      below, on the right. That&rsquo;s a shuffler. Mr. Wymett. Owns The Guardian and
      runs it. Now here&rsquo;s a mincer. Dainty an&rsquo; soft he goes an&rsquo; dainty an&rsquo; soft
      he lives: the Rev. Mr. Merserole, rector of our rich folks&rsquo; church. For
      all that, there&rsquo;s stuff an&rsquo; weight in his shoes.&rdquo; His hand hovered and
      touched a pair of elegantly made, low, laced Oxfords, of almost feminine
      delicacy. &ldquo;Style there, eh? Know what they want, those shoes. Got to be
      jest so. Spick an&rsquo; span. They say Montrose Clark never has to pay to have
      &rsquo;em cleaned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why is that?&rdquo; asked Jeremy, responsive to the look of invitation in the
      old man&rsquo;s eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Got so many boot-lickers around him,&rdquo; chuckled the philosopher. &ldquo;Kick you
      as soon as look at you, those would, for all they look so finicky.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come in to see you when I need pointers about people,&rdquo; said Jeremy,
      smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Boot &amp; Shoe Surgeon handed him the repaired golf-boots. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m an
      ignorant old man,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I know folks&rsquo;s feet and sometimes I can
      guess what path they&rsquo;ll take. I&rsquo;ve been talking pretty free to you, Mr.
      Robson, for a stranger. But I reckon you&rsquo;re trustable, &rsquo;spite of
      what Nick Milliken says.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon I am, Doctor Wade,&rdquo; returned Jeremy, and believed himself as he
      said it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes: the old man likes to talk,&rdquo; confessed Eli Wade; &ldquo;an&rsquo; about people.
      Gossip, some call it. That&rsquo;s a silly word. What&rsquo;s history but gossip about
      folks that are dead? But, of course, a man like me has to be careful who
      he talks to, being in public life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; acquiesced the amused Jeremy. &ldquo;But I did n&rsquo;t know you were in
      public life. What office do you hold?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m on the Fenchester Public School Board,&rdquo; said Eli Wade with simple but
      profound pride.

      CHAPTER V
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">B</span>OBOLINK on a
      grass-tuft piped ecstatic welcome to a long-lost friend, the sun. Five
      gray and weary days had passed since that amiable orb had bestowed so much
      as one uncloaked beam upon birds and men, and on each of those rain-soaked
      days, Jeremy Robson had racked his overstrained vocabulary for new
      objurgations against the malign fates which had spread a watery barrier
      between himself and Marcia Ames. Now the sun was an hour above the eastern
      horizon with a flawless sky outspread like a luxurious carpet for its
      day&rsquo;s journey. Secure at that hour in the undisputed possession of the
      earth, bobolink swayed and sang, when to its wrath and amaze a shining
      missile descended from the sky and bounded with sprightly twists toward
      its chosen choir-loft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sliced into the rough again,&rdquo; said a voice of despair from the hollow
      below, and two figures appeared, headed toward the singer, who moved on
      with an indignant and expostulatory chirp, but found another perch still
      within ear-shot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because you will <i>not</i> keep your head down,&rdquo; reprehended the deeper
      tones of the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bobolink stretched his liquid throat in a love-song. He sang the warm
      sweetness of the earth, and the conquering glory of the sun; the breeze&rsquo;s
      kiss and the welcome of the flower for the bees, and youth which is made
      up of all these and comes but once. Out of a full heart he sent forth his
      missioning call to young hearts; then, as the girl turned an exquisite
      face toward him, he waited for her response.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is four,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;and I am not out yet.&rdquo; And she hewed away a
      whole clump of innocent daisies, with one ferocious chop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should have used a niblick the first time,&rdquo; observed the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perceiving that romance had forever departed from the human race when, on
      such a May morning, such a maid and such a youth could satisfy their soul
      with such conversation as this, bobolink flew away to a tussock in an
      adjacent field where his own private romance was safe hidden.
    </p>
    <p>
      To versatile human kind, it is given to make love in many and diverse
      manners uncomprehended of the bird species. Not the least ingenious of his
      species, Mr. Jeremy Robson had marked out as his first step the
      establishment of a systematic association with Miss Marcia Ames, through
      golf; and until that association could be trusted to walk alone, as it
      were, he purposed to confine his attention strictly to the matter in hand.
      Her desire to make the college team was a very genuine one, and he guessed
      her to be a young lady of no small determination. Therefore, he was well
      satisfied to observe that, on this their first experiment as teacher and
      pupil, she was playing rather poorly. This meant longer and more arduous
      practice. At the end of the first round, during which he had devoted close
      attention but scant suggestion to her performance, he was four up and her
      card showed a painful total.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fifty-twos will never land you anywhere,&rdquo; was the conclusion which he
      derived from the addition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is to be done?&rdquo; she asked in her precise English. &ldquo;I grow worse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you read Ibsen?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have read him a great deal. But not upon golf,&rdquo; said Miss Ames with
      raised eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does your playing suggest any particular character of his?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are being absurd. Or is it one of your riddles, at which I am not
      clever?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m giving you a test in self-analysis. &lsquo;The Ibsen character whom you
      suggest, particularly when you play your iron shots, is Little Eyolf. The
      l silent, as in &rsquo;Hades.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not think that a very funny joke,&rdquo; she said scornfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been turned down by three comic papers, though,&rdquo; he defended.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why must I bear it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To make the point stick in your memory. Once, quite early in the morning,
      I came around the corner of a barn on a Philadelphia golf course, and
      there was a nice-looking elderly lady whom I had seen the day before
      taking her two small grandchildren out walking, addressing a ball with a
      brassie and saying, &lsquo;Eye on the ball; slow back; carry through. Eye on the
      ball; slow back; carry through,&rsquo; over and over again. Brassie shots were
      her weakness. The next day that persevering old grandma went out and made
      low score in the National Women&rsquo;s Championship. Now, if you&rsquo;ll just think
      of yourself as Little Eyolf until you&rsquo;re good and mad, it&rsquo;ll help do the
      trick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What were you doing in Philadelphia?&rdquo; inquired the girl irrelevantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not golfing,&rdquo; he returned. &ldquo;So, if you don&rsquo;t mind, we&rsquo;ll postpone that.
      This is a golf lesson, and right here the serious business of the day
      begins. The first consideration is to cure you of star-gazing. You
      appreciate that that&rsquo;s your main trouble?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Raising my head, you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it. Star-gazing, we call it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It occurs because I forget myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And mostly on your irons. You get your wooden shots off clean. Now, let&rsquo;s
      drive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Two straight shots flew down the course, his the longer by fifteen yards.
      A ninety-yard approach lay before her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beginneth here the first lesson,&rdquo; said Jeremy. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a sure cure, on the
      homoeopathic principle. Invented it myself for a fellow on our college
      team who was a stargazer, and he showed his gratitude by eliminating me
      from the individual championship, that fall.&rdquo; He took a cardboard box from
      his pocket, and extracted from it one of a number of small, gilt stars
      such as stationers carry in stock. This he pressed down upon the grass so
      close behind his pupil&rsquo;s ball as almost to touch its lower arc. &ldquo;Behold
      the star of your hopes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What am I to do with it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep your eye on it&mdash;if you can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Until after I have struck the ball?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Longer than that. After you&rsquo;ve played, step forward and plant the sole of
      your foot on the star. But you won&rsquo;t be able to do it. Not the first
      time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall,&rdquo; said the girl with quiet conviction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Taking her stance, she measured the distance with a careful eye, and sent
      the ball off with a clean click. Her head remained bent with an almost
      devotional intentness. She stepped forward and covered the star with that
      boot which Eli Wade had so warmly praised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; approved the instructor. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got will power.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have needed to have,&rdquo; replied the girl. Her tone was curiously musing
      and confidential. &ldquo;May I look up now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely. &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll like the view.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The ball, rising high, had landed upon the edge of the green and rolled to
      within ten feet of the cup.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Do you suppose I could do it again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any number of times, if you&rsquo;ll keep your eye on the star.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But one could not carry about a box of stars in a match, could one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One could. But it won&rsquo;t be necessary. Two weeks&rsquo; practice at that will
      get you clean out of the Little Eyolf habit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will it, indeed? But why do you look so intently at the spot?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; said Jeremy hastily. &ldquo;It was your boot&mdash;I mean,
      I was thinking what that queer old codger Eli Wade said when I went after
      your boots.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And was <i>that</i> golf?&rdquo; inquired Miss Ames with a demure and candid
      air. &ldquo;No? Then, if you do not mind, we will postpone it, shall we not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stung!&rdquo; confessed Jeremy. &ldquo;We shall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The bestarred second round cut no less than five strokes from the score of
      the gratified pupil and her even more highly pleased instructor. This in
      spite of the fact that she had once lifted her head and perpetrated a
      lamen table foozle, whereupon Jeremy gravely pasted one of the stars on
      the toe of her left boot: &ldquo;To keep you reminded,&rdquo; he explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve got to clip at least three more strokes off to be
      safe. That&rsquo;ll take you all your time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It took a disproportionate amount of Jeremy Robson&rsquo;s, too, which, to do
      him justice, he did not begrudge. As a corollary to the morning lessons he
      took to dropping in at the Pritchard mansion of an evening to discuss some
      of the more abstruse points of the game, where he found himself in active
      competition with the picked youth of the University and the town, for Miss
      Marcia gathered a court as irresistibly as a flower gathers bees. Quite
      unjustifiably Jeremy was inclined to sulk a bit over this, unmindful of
      the favor of the gods in affording him her undivided companionship in
      those early morning hours. Whereupon the gods, as is their custom,
      withdrew their unappreciated bestowals. Buddy Higman discovered the golf
      practice and straightway volunteered as caddy. Jealousy as well as desire
      to be of service to the liege lady prompted his offer, which was
      straightway accepted. So the morning practice continued while bobolink
      from his daisied choir-loft (no longer invaded by balls wandering from the
      straight and narrow path which leads to the House of Bogie) alternately
      cheered and jeered at this chaperoned companionship.
    </p>
    <p>
      One stroke, two strokes, and finally five strokes were subtracted from the
      aspirant&rsquo;s nine-hole score. Her master gave her his blessing and told her
      to go in and win. In the Varsity competition, she qualified with a highly
      respectable round, and in the play-off for the team, won her place. The
      team captain posted the choice for the yearly match against Kirk College
      on the athletic bulletin, one line of which read:
    </p>
    <p>
      No. 4&mdash;M. Ames.
    </p>
    <p>
      In special celebration of the event, the pupil accepted an invitation to
      dine at the Country Club that evening with the instructor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you make an agreement?&rdquo; she asked, as they faced each other across
      the little table, pleasantly remote in a far corner of the veranda.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unsight-unseen?&rdquo; he smiled. &ldquo;All right. I&rsquo;ll swap.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is quite too American for me. But you agree. Then let us not speak
      the word &lsquo;golf&rsquo; all this evening. I am tired of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stale,&rdquo; commented the expert. &ldquo;You must lay off for a week. Well, let&rsquo;s
      forget it. What shall we talk about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you doing here in Fenchester?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He smiled at the directness of the question. &ldquo;Plain and fancy reporting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not seem to belong here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What makes you think that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She considered him meditatively. &ldquo;I suppose it was your clothes, first.
      You dress differently from the others. More like the men I have known over
      there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remnants of past glory,&rdquo; he assured her lightly. &ldquo;I have n&rsquo;t always lived
      here, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where then? Do you mind my asking?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a bit. I&rsquo;ve drifted about doing worthless things for several years.
      Philadelphia mainly, New York a little. Getting myself mis-educated. You
      see, I&rsquo;m something of a failure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should not say that even in fun. I do not like to hear it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is n&rsquo;t in fun. Ask my aged and highly respectable great-aunt, Miss
      Greer, in Philadelphia, and you&rsquo;ll learn something to my disadvantage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall,&rdquo; said the girl gravely, &ldquo;if I ever go back there. Did you live
      with her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For a time. After my college course she sent me on a year&rsquo;s tour and then
      made me take one of those ornamental post-graduate courses that lead into
      the lily-fingered occupations that are neither professions nor business.
      She had a fond hope that I&rsquo;d take to diplomacy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; said the girl with unflattering surprise. &ldquo;I know many diplomats. I
      do not think you would be successful there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m about as diplomatic as a punch in the eye,&rdquo; admitted her companion.
      &ldquo;The old lady considered it plumb disgusting of me not to take to refined
      international mendacity. But then I did n&rsquo;t take to much of anything else
      that she laid out for me. I had vulgar tastes. I wanted to go into the
      newspaper business, and when I&rsquo;d learnt it, have Great-Aunt kindly buy me
      a paper to play with. Great-Aunt did n&rsquo;t see it that way. She cut me off
      with a small amount of hard cash and a large amount of hard talk, and I
      took a School of Journalism course and eventually drifted out here because
      I liked what I remembered of the town and wanted to bore in where I was
      n&rsquo;t hampered by friends and acquaintances. Does that strike you as a
      record of glowing success? Considering that I&rsquo;m nearly twenty-seven years
      old, and have n&rsquo;t made a scratch on the face of the world yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you began late,&rdquo; condoned his companion. &ldquo;And you are still learning.
      But I cannot see why your aunt should object to your wishing to own a
      newspaper. One would say, a harmless ambition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One that I&rsquo;m quite unlikely to realize, now. As for its being harmless,
      why, my dear child&mdash;excuse the freedom of an aged golf-professor&mdash;there&rsquo;s
      a charge of dynamite in every font of type.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you have a penchant for high explosives?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I? I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d put it that way,&rdquo; mused Jeremy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a taste
      for adventure. And running a newspaper of your own has always seemed to me
      about the liveliest and most adventurous job going. But I don&rsquo;t want to
      blow things up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, just to have a hand in things, in a real, live American community
      like this, where the soil is good and new ideas sprout. I&rsquo;d like to get
      into the political fight, too. A really good one, I mean, with something
      worth aiming at.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I can understand. But I still fail to make you fit into this
      environment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about yourself?&rdquo; he countered &ldquo;Have n&rsquo;t you rather the air of coming
      out of the great world and condescending to this raw and rural town?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I? Have I been condescending to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you had, it would be more than I deserve,&rdquo; he said contritely. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d no
      business to say that. And I did n&rsquo;t mean it, anyway. But this is a queer
      place for you to be, is n&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not for my purposes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you specializing at Old Central?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One might call it that. I made inquiries for the most typically American
      college, and a list was made up for me. I chose the University of
      Centralia to be with my mother&rsquo;s cousin, Miss Pritchard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just like that? All yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All myself,&rdquo; she assented gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You came here to get Americanized?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. My mother married again. A German. A man of great scientific
      attainments and high position. He is very gentle and vague and
      absent-minded, and good to me. And when I told them that I would like to
      take my own money and come here to my own country for a year before&rdquo;&mdash;she
      hesitated almost imperceptibly&mdash;&ldquo;before anything was settled for me,
      he consented. Think what a wrench it must have been for his old-world
      prejudices against emancipated women and all that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet I don&rsquo;t think you need Americanizing. You&rsquo;re a real American type if
      there ever was one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She flushed a little. &ldquo;I like to hear that. My father would have liked it.
      What makes you say it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s your honesty, I think. There&rsquo;s a quality of frankness
      about you that could be&mdash;well, almost brutal, I think. Do you know
      what I mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I am a crank. That is American enough, is it not?&rdquo; she laughed.
      &ldquo;A crank about the truth. I hate anything that even suggests a lie, or a
      dodging, or an evasion. So perhaps I should not like your newspaper
      profession.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s just it!&rdquo; he cried eagerly. &ldquo;If one had a paper of one&rsquo;s own,
      he could make his own rules for the game.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he were big enough&mdash;and brave enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brave enough,&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Eli Wade said that about you, too. Reading
      your character from your shoes, you know. That you had courage and
      honesty. I think he thought it a rare thing in a woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not,&rdquo; she flashed. &ldquo;But if I have, it is no credit to me. I have
      wholly loved and trusted only one person on earth. That was my father, and
      he was the soul of truth. So, some of my friends laugh at me a little and
      think me a crank, because I have&mdash;what do you Americans&mdash;<i>we</i>
      Americans say?&mdash;no use for any one whom I cannot wholly trust.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you would be hard, too,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps. If I were, it would be because I could not help it. I think that
      I do things because something inside makes me before I have even time to
      consider, sometimes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like your standing up alone at the Federated German meeting. By the way,
      I brought my story of it for you to read.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She held out her hand for the proofs. &ldquo;I am glad,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She read it, slowly and studiously, and as she read an expression, new to
      Jeremy in the changeful charm of her face, puzzled his watchful eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very vivid,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and enthusiastic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She rose. On their way back to the Pritchard house she plied him with
      questions bearing on the technique of journalism. As he stood, bareheaded
      under the porch light looking up at her, she asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I keep the proof of the article?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. You like it, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love it. But I am glad that it was not published.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is too much Me in it.&rdquo; She paused. &ldquo;Did I seem to you like that&mdash;then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. And more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head. &ldquo;I am glad that it was not published,&rdquo; she repeated.
      &ldquo;It would have said to too many people&mdash;&rdquo; She hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the first time her eyes faltered before his. They were hesitant, and
      deep-shadowed and troubled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; he repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What should have been said to only one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marcia!&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the door had closed on her and he barely heard her soft-toned
      &ldquo;Good-night&rdquo; from beyond its jealous interception.

      CHAPTER VI
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>BSTENTION from the
      art and practice of golf for one week had been Professor Robson&rsquo;s ukase.
      Had he foreseen the course of more personal events he would never have
      issued it. For he now had no opportunity of seeing his pupil alone.
      Nothing so direct as avoidance could be charged against her. But since
      that parting on the Pritchard porch, he had never been able to achieve so
      much as two minutes of her undivided time. Her eyes, when they met his
      only to be swiftly withdrawn, were sweetly troubled. The Eternal Feminine
      within her was, for the time at least, in flight. And along those paths of
      delicate elusiveness, the clumsy and pursuing feet of man stumble and
      trip. Jeremy&rsquo;s soul was sorely tried and not less sorely puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      If he found difficulties in Marcia&rsquo;s attitude, his own future course with
      regard to her was dubious. What could he, in his position and with his
      resources, ask of her? To wait? Certainly nothing more than that. And was
      even that much fair to her? His own feeling was simplicity itself. Life
      had, in these few short weeks of association, summed and compressed itself
      into his love for Marcia Ames. Until that abrupt change in the tone of
      their relations brought about by her half-acceptance of his devotion, she
      had never evinced anything more than a frank and confident comradeship.
      Now he felt that he might speak&mdash;if he could find opportunity. That
      he could not, almost caused him to accuse Marcia of unfairness. Yet could
      he honorably ask her to marry him and tie herself to a meager and as yet
      unpromising career? Within himself Jeremy had begun to assume that
      confidence of future success which comes with the assured sense of
      workmanship. He would cheerfully gamble his own future on it. But how
      could he ask her to risk hers? Even supposing that she cared for him!
      There was the thought that ached; the uncertainty of it. In any case he
      had to know how it stood with him in her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon her inviolable truthfulness he could depend for a full and fair
      answer, if he were able to state his case. He knew that all her frank and
      unevasive courage would answer to his demand; that she would look that
      fate, or any other, steadily in the eyes. But not before her own good
      time. And that the time was not yet, became sufficiently apparent, one
      week before the match when the lessons were resumed, for with the
      resumption Buddy Higman was quietly established at once as caddy,
      chaperon, and dragon with the added qualities of the modestly adhesive
      burdock. The skill and technique of &ldquo;No. 4.&mdash;M. Ames&rdquo; prospered and
      improved mightily, which is more than can be said of the disposition of
      her instructor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some men&rsquo;s work would have suffered. Not Jeremy&rsquo;s. He was of that
      fortunate temperament which, keeping its troubles to itself, boils them
      out into steam and transforms the steam into energy. Besides, he had now
      &ldquo;the grip of his pen.&rdquo; He derived a glowing satisfaction from the expert
      performance of his craft. The editorial page was hospitable to him,
      especially for contributions in lighter vein. Many special assignments for
      work out of the ordinary, calling for a knack of description or
      characterization, came to him. His writings were beginning to earn the
      knighthood conferred by the clipping shears and the paste-pot. Newspapers
      in larger cities than Fenches-ter copied and privately asked questions
      about them. But what made it all so worth while, what gave a touch of
      exaltation to the dogged purpose for success, was the conviction that all
      this forwarded him upon the road which led to Marcia.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tournament with Kirk College, on the Fenchester Country Club grounds,
      was now two days away. Jeremy had asked for and obtained the assignment to
      cover it. He had long before applied for and received the job of caddying
      for No. 4 of the team opposing his own college, which was regarded by the
      visiting Kirks as an ignoble instance of loyalty corrupted by the baser
      passions. However, Jeremy was perfectly willing that Kirk should win;
      rather hoped it would, in fact, provided only the No. 4 of Old Central
      beat her man. He believed her capable of doing it, unless her nerve
      faltered, which he deemed improbable. On her most recent performances she
      was from two to four strokes lower than any one but himself and Buddy
      Higman appreciated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Important though the event was to Jeremy Robson, the authorities on The
      Record considered it rather a waste of their brilliant youngster&rsquo;s time.
      However, they were appeased by the cropping out meantime of a story so
      much in the Robson line that it might have been made to order for him.
      Wackley, the managing editor, outlined it to him, when he arrived in the
      morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Robson, do you know a queer old bat up on Banks Street who runs a shoe
      surgery?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eli Wade? Yes; quite well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a nut of the old Know-Nothing kind, is n&rsquo;t he? Hates all foreigners
      and all that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a pretty hard-shelled Yankee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well; he&rsquo;s done it this time. Made a fine young riot for himself last
      night. It seems he&rsquo;s been pasting cartoons and mottoes in his show window;
      and some of the younger fellows from the Deutscher Club, who pass there on
      their way home, naturally got sore. Last night with a few beers aboard,
      they stopped and gave him a raree serenade. Out comes the old boy in his
      nighty and makes &rsquo;em a red-hot speech. They give him the whoop, and
      he begins to damn &rsquo;em all back to Germany.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; he&rsquo;s got fighting stuff in him,&rdquo; agreed Jeremy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too much for his own good. Somebody ups with a rock, and down comes the
      big boot over the door. Well, the old boy goes dippy over that. Dives
      inside and grabs up a hammer and right into them. First thing you know,
      they have him on a rail&mdash;a scantling from that new building on the
      corner&mdash;and are yelling for tar. It might have been serious for the
      old boy, but just then along comes Andy Galpin of The Guardian. You know
      him; he&rsquo;s some young husky. Guard on the O. C. team for three years. Well,
      he bucks the center and lays out a couple of the merry villagers and
      there&rsquo;s a pretty mix-up, and I understand Galpin got one in the eye that
      did n&rsquo;t improve his make-up. But the boys were sick of the fun anyway, and
      they let Galpin get away with it and take old Wade home. Instead of doing
      the sensible thing and sleeping it off, Wade gets all het up, and swears
      out warrants and they&rsquo;re going to thrash it out in police court this noon,
      in time for the edition. Probably Wade &rsquo;ll make a speech. Anyhow,
      there&rsquo;ll be a circus when he goes on the stand. We want a rattling good
      story on it; and put in your best touches on the old boy. He&rsquo;ll do for a
      local character to hang all sorts of stories on, later.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But look here, Mr. Wackley: I know Eli Wade pretty well. He&rsquo;s&mdash;he&rsquo;s
      a sort of friend of mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What if he is? You can have fun with him, can&rsquo;t you? He won&rsquo;t know the
      difference. And if he does, he won&rsquo;t care. Those fanatical guys are crazy
      for publicity. He&rsquo;ll eat it up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Jeremy&rsquo;s settled intention, so he told himself, as he set out for
      court, to write an account which, while lively, should fairly set forth
      his friend&rsquo;s side. When he saw Eli Wade at court his heart misgave him,
      the Boot &amp; Shoe Surgeon looked so whitely wrathful. The proceedings
      dwindled into nothing. The &ldquo;life&rdquo; was out of the story, quite to one
      reporter&rsquo;s relief, when his evil genius inspired Eli Wade to address the
      court. At the outset he was simple and dignified. But counsel for the
      serenaders interpolated some well-timed taunts which roused him to
      indignation. He had not slept that night, for shame of the treatment to
      which he had been subjected; and his self-control was in abeyance.
      Indignation, as he answered the taunts, waxed to fury. He burst into a
      savage and absurd invective, aimed at &ldquo;German interlopers,&rdquo; &ldquo;foreign clubs
      that run our city,&rdquo; and the like; his voice shrilling louder and louder
      until he was drowned out by the uncontrollable laughter of the court-room.
      It was all quite absurd and pitiable. Instinctively Jeremy&rsquo;s pencil took
      it down. Here was his story, ready to hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he sat in the office, the grip of characterization settled upon him.
      Oddments and gleams of past conversations in the &ldquo;Infirmary&rdquo; came back to
      him, and he embodied them. Stroke by stroke there grew up under his hand a
      portrait, crude from haste but vivid, telling, and a stimulant to mirth,
      not always of the kindliest. It was not intentionally unfair; it was never
      malicious in purpose. But it was the more deadly in effect. By the magic
      transformation of print it made out of an unpolished, simple, generous,
      fervent, and thoughtful artisan, a laughable homunculus. Yet there was in
      it no element of &ldquo;fake.&rdquo; Jeremy could have defended it at all points. Any
      newspaper judgment would have credited it with due fidelity to facts. The
      sum-total was a subtle and gross misrepresentation. Had the writer read it
      over he would perhaps have seen this for himself. But there was no time.
      He barely caught the edition. Wackley&rsquo;s: &ldquo;Great stuff, my boy! You&rsquo;ll hear
      of this,&rdquo; happily distracted him from the stirrings of a conscience which
      faintly wished to know how Eli Wade would take it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re doing golf to-morrow,&rdquo; continued the managing editor. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
      bother to come to the office first.&rdquo; Profiting by this, Jeremy, an hour
      before match time, called at Miss Pritchard&rsquo;s for Marcia. He was informed
      that she had left on an errand, but would meet him at the Country Club.
      When, just before the first pair teed up, she appeared, her mentor was
      startled, she looked so wan and languid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Heavens!&rdquo; said Jeremy in a whisper. &ldquo;You have n&rsquo;t let this thing get
      on your nerves?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head. Her eyes did not avoid his now; but the changeful
      lights seemed to have dwindled to the merest flicker in inscrutable
      depths.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me get you a cup of coffee. That&rsquo;ll brace you up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be all right,&rdquo; she said with an effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the call for the fourth pair she stepped to the tee and hit a ball
      straight down the center for 160-odd yards. It was the virtue of her game
      that she was straight on the pin, nine shots out of ten, thereby
      overcoming the handicap of greater distance sure to be against her in
      college competition. Great and grinful was the satisfaction of her trainer
      at observing the demeanor of her opponent. When he was presented to her,
      that gentleman, a sightly and powerful youth notable for his long drives,
      took one extended, admiring, and astounded survey of &ldquo;M. Ames&rdquo;&mdash;he
      had n&rsquo;t known what the bewildering fates held in store for him inquired
      privately but passionately of high Heaven and his team-mates how a fellow
      was going to keep his eye on the ball with a vision like <i>that</i> to
      look at, and entered upon a disastrous career by nearly slaying, with his
      first drive, a squirrel in a tree a good hundred yards off the course. He
      recovered in time to record an unparalleled ten for the first hole. M.
      Ames, dead on the pin, scored a correct five. Everson (the Kirk boy)
      contributed three putts on the second green, and M. Ames won it in a sound
      four. But as his pupil took her stance for a brassie, after a respectable
      tee-shot from the third, Jeremy perceived with dismay that her hands were
      shaking. Up went her head, as she swung, and the ball darted from the toe
      of her club into the rough. She was out in three, but again she succumbed
      to star-gazing on her mashie shot, and her opponent still triangulating
      the course like a care-free surveyor, was able to halve it. From then on,
      Jeremy the mentor was in agony. Except off the tees, where she clung to
      her beautiful, free-limbed, lissome swing, as it were by instinct, No. 4
      for Old Central topped, sliced, pulled, and scarified the helpless turf.
      The gallant foeman was so distressed at her obviously unusual ineptitudes,
      that his own game went glimmering down the grassy bypaths that lead to
      traps and bunkers. Only this involuntary gallantry saved M. Ames from
      practical extinction. As it was, she was two down at the end of the first
      nine, with a dismal fifty-four. As they left the ninth green she turned to
      Jeremy: &ldquo;Would you mind not caddying for me the rest of the match?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Marcia!&rdquo; he cried, aghast. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have got on my nerves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have n&rsquo;t said a word except to steady you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; she said inflexibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      An angry gleam flashed in Jeremy&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;Of course, if you feel that way
      about it&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do. I am sorry,&rdquo; she repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mind my following you?&rdquo; he asked with semisardonic intent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should rather you did not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, good Heavens! Something has happened to spoil your nerve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come for me after the match. We can talk then.&rdquo; With this Jeremy had to
      be content. Relieved of his presence, M. Ames summoned all her force to
      the rescue of her nerves, and astonished her opponent with a forty-four,
      steadily and carefully played. The match, which had originally been
      counted upon by a careful captain as a probable win for Old Central, was a
      tie, under the scoring system agreed upon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dismal misgivings, meanwhile, had beset Jeremy Robson, the promising young
      reporter of The Record. Already he was, in his heart, on the defensive
      when, as he and Marcia turned out at the gate, she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you write the article about Eli Wade?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought it must have been yours,&rdquo; said her lips. The tone said, &ldquo;I
      hoped it was not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good sign, for people to recognize my style. What did you think
      of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was clever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no warmth in the tone. Rather a reluctant relinquishment of
      disbelief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you liked it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not like it. I hated it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s the personal view,&rdquo; he said indulgently. &ldquo;Perhaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Bellair Journal has offered me a job on the strength of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were you obliged to take that&mdash;what is the term&mdash;that
      assignment?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A reporter takes what is handed out to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose so. That would be the danger. I should fear that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fear what? I can&rsquo;t imagine you fearing anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should fear getting into that habit of mind. Complaisant. Servile.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s an ugly word, Marcia,&rdquo; he said, flushing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry. Perhaps there is a side to it that I do not understand. But
      surely, oh, surely, you need not have written it in that way!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear girl! Personal feeling has no relation to newspaper work. I can&rsquo;t
      juggle with facts because the man happens to be my friend. That is n&rsquo;t
      honest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is <i>this</i> honest?&rdquo; She held up the clipping which she took from her
      pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy quailed before the hurtness of her eyes, which was wonder more than
      reproach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is n&rsquo;t a word in it,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is not a thought in it that is not a cruel injustice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve no right to say that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true. You remind me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Marcia,&rdquo; he cried miserably. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t take it that way. I&rsquo;d have thrown
      up my job sooner than write it if I&rsquo;d known that you&rsquo;d feel it so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It does not matter about me. But you! How could you have done it! How
      could you have used his gentle, sweet, simple philosophy&mdash;his talks
      between friends in the shop&mdash;to make a mock of him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did n&rsquo;t. I swear I did n&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She put the clipping into his hand. Re-read, now, the words were
      self-damnatory. Jeremy groaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has hurt him so terribly,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve seen him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. He has resigned his place on the School Board. Mr. Dolge advised him
      to get off before he was laughed off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy stared at the words of his facile portraiture as if they had
      suddenly been informed with venom. &ldquo;And he was so proud of it!&rdquo; he
      muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a large thing in his little life,&rdquo; said the girl. &ldquo;He feels
      disgraced.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wackley&rsquo;s easy and cynical assumption that the subject of the sketch would
      be &ldquo;crazy for publicity&rdquo; recalled itself to Jeremy. He swore beneath his
      breath. &ldquo;When did you see Eli?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This morning. At the hospital.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The hospital! Is he injured that badly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. You had not heard? It is Mr. Galpin, a friend of Eli&rsquo;s&mdash;who
      stood by him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Andy Galpin! How bad is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much worse than they supposed. He will be nearly blind in one eye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Lord!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And is he a friend of yours, also; Mr. Galpin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Andy? Yes; of course he is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you made no inquiry about him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did n&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes, steady and deep-lighted, still did not judge him, still
      pathetically wondered at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marcia!&rdquo; he broke out. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t been able to think of anything but you.
      I have n&rsquo;t had anything in my heart&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped, appealing to her with his look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you have to think of Eli Wade.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy winced and was silent. Their car pulled up at the Pritchard gate.
      She got out, but did not ask him to come in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The worst of it is that it&rsquo;s hurt you,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;I did n&rsquo;t know that
      you cared so much about him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was not he that I cared so much about,&rdquo; returned Marcia steadily. &ldquo;It
      was you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned and passed into the house. Try as he might, on his way to the
      hospital to see Andrew Galpin, Jeremy could derive from that low-toned
      avowal neither hope nor comfort for a sick heart and a grilling
      conscience.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctors would not let him see Galpin.
    </p>
    <p>
      As by tradition bound, his &ldquo;story&rdquo; of the golf match focused on the one
      and unique girl-player on the team. She was the &ldquo;human interest&rdquo; center.
      So skillfully did he skirt the edge of her bad play that only an analysis
      of the score would apprise the reader of the partial failure. Her good
      shots were described in glowing terms. To her, the casual reader would
      have supposed, belonged the chief credit on Old Central&rsquo;s side; and the
      copy-reader, who was no golfer, in good faith headed it &ldquo;Miss Ames Gains
      Tie for O. C.&rdquo;; the final team score having also been all even, though it
      should have been Old Central&rsquo;s victory had No. 4 played up to her
      standard. The writing of the article cheered up the writer notably. Here
      was no wounding word or acid-bitten phrase. There was only the clear
      purpose to please. Again Jeremy had been caught and carried in the whirl
      of his semi-creative enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      The quality was still there when he read it over on the following day.
      Intent upon his sunshine-scattering he sent an early proof to &ldquo;M. Ames.&rdquo;
       He felt, on the whole, that he had been, if not unjustly, at least
      untenderly treated. Overnight he had been able to persuade himself that
      the Wade sketch represented a fine type of loyalty to profession rising
      triumphant above personal feelings. All that was needed to reestablish him
      firmly in the conviction of righteousness, was Marcia&rsquo;s appreciation of
      his golf-story. He went to the Pritchard house to receive it. Marcia was
      not there. She had gone for a few days&rsquo; visit at the Magnus Laurens&rsquo;
      country place. Jeremy sent a hasty, reproachful and alarmed note after
      her. Why had she left without a word? What did it all mean? When was she
      coming back? When could he see her and explain? As a composition it was
      distinctly below standard for the rising young star of The Record. But at
      least it could boast the highly-prized quality of heart-interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy called again at the hospital to see Andrew Galpin. That battered
      warrior received him with immitigable cheerfulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay-ah,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;Something busted inside the eye. It ain&rsquo;t as bad
      as they thought. They&rsquo;re going to save quite a glimmer of sight in it, and
      &lsquo;my right eye is a good little eye,&rdquo;&rsquo; he chanted. &ldquo;Back on the job in a
      week or so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy, craving solace, asked whether his friend had seen the Eli Wade
      story; then, remembering his disability, corrected himself hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure I saw it. Or had it seen for me. I made &rsquo;em read me both
      papers from end to end. That was a crackajack story. You keep on like
      this, young fellow, and Fenchester &rsquo;ll be too small to hold you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it hurt Eli Wade&rsquo;s feelings,&rdquo; said the visitor hesitantly.
      &ldquo;Did he say anything to you about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay-ah. He spoke of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did he say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We-ell; he said&mdash;Sure you want to know?&rdquo; Jeremy nodded. &ldquo;He said,
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;d never have believed it from the way he wears his shoes.&rsquo; Like the
      poor old nut, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Andy, was the story so rotten?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I just told you it was a crackajack piece of work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not talking about that. I&rsquo;m talking about my doing it at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was your assignment, was n&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, it was,&rdquo; assented Jeremy, comforted and justified. &ldquo;I had to
      take it or quit my job, did n&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I guess you&rsquo;re stronger than that on The Record.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would you have done in my place?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me? Oh, I&rsquo;m a reporter. I reckon I&rsquo;d have done the story.&rdquo; But there was
      no conviction in Galpin&rsquo;s tone. Jeremy wished he could have seen the
      bandaged eyes. He mistrusted that they would have avoided his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s part of the business,&rdquo; he declared, self-defensively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the hell of the business,&rdquo; said Andrew Galpin. Jeremy left the
      hospital feeling that Marcia Ames and Andrew Galpin had said much the same
      thing to him about his article, in widely different terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marcia&rsquo;s reply to his note came several days later. Its brevity did not
      conceal an indefinable and disturbing reserve. She would see him, she
      wrote, when she returned. With the note was inclosed the proof of the golf
      report. Its margin carried a penciled note.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you not see that this only makes it worse?&rdquo; Jeremy read his cherished
      report once more, and saw. It was a lie.

      CHAPTER VII

      thrusts a long and slender arm past Fenchester to throw it cherishingly
      about a tiny island, cut off from the University campus and made part of
      it again by an arched bridge overhanging dappled waters. Willows bending
      from the islet&rsquo;s bank weave their thousand-fingered enchantments above the
      dreaming shallows. The subtle spice of sedge and marsh-bloom blows from it
      to disperse its spell upon the air that whispers a never-finished tale of
      secrecy and sorcery to the trees. It is a place of witchery.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sheen of countless stars glowed above the bridge and wavered below it,
      as two figures emerged from the pathway and paused at the summit of the
      arch to lean and look down through the darkness at the blackly opalescent
      gleam of the waters. A canoe stole around the bend and slipped beneath
      them, the stroke of its paddles accentuated in cool, delicious plashes of
      sound as it entered the arch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another two,&rdquo; said the soft and happy voice of a girl, rising to them;
      and a boyish voice answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The night is full of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The canoe merged with the darkness. The two figures on the bridge, silent,
      followed it with their blind speculations into an unknown world. From far
      across the open spaces of the lake came the music of women&rsquo;s voices
      blended, which the night breeze hushed to hear; a modulation of wistful,
      minor strains:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &ldquo;In dreams she grows not older

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter couplet was repeated, a haunting, yearning, falling melody,
      that suddenly swelled and rose into the splendid, fulfilling major:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &ldquo;In dreams doth he behold her
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Still fair and kind and young.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The taller figure on the bridge stirred from a dream. &ldquo;That is your song,
      Marcia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the girl, a little away from him in the darkness. &ldquo;I arranged
      it for them, to be sung so; in parts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You sang it the first day we really began to know each other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very long ago,&rdquo; she assented, with her serene gravity. &ldquo;Two months, is it
      not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or years. Or centuries. It does n&rsquo;t seem to matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad they sang that to-night. For us,&rdquo; she concluded, after the
      briefest of pauses.
    </p>
    <p>
      He put his hand over hers, which rested on the stone coping of the bridge.
      She did not stir nor speak. But it was his hand, not hers, that trembled.
      A heavy rowboat came lumbering down the reach, two students at the oars.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Politics for me,&rdquo; said one confidently. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to run the country
      from this end now. I&rsquo;m for Mart Embree&rsquo;s band-wagon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too dull,&rdquo; said another. &ldquo;Gimme a touch of Nuh York.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a rough world for poor, lost lambs like us to be spilled into,
      anyway,&rdquo; boomed a resonant bass from the stern seat, and their laughter
      died away around the bend of the island.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marcia Ames freed her fingers from her companion&rsquo;s clasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jem,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her figure, dim-white in the darkness, neither withdrew from nor swayed
      toward him. But he thought that he saw her head half turn with a sorrowful
      intent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jem,&rdquo; she said again, &ldquo;I came here to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love you, Marcia,&rdquo; he repeated with a still insistence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait. I am going away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very soon. This week. Perhaps sooner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For how long?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you not understand, Jem? I am going away.&rdquo; The quiet repetition
      fell, chill and deadening, upon his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From everything here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you don&rsquo;t care!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going back?&rdquo; He made an obvious effort to gather his force for the
      determinative word. &ldquo;Abroad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll follow you,&rdquo; he declared grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you are angry with me, are you not?&rdquo; She spoke with a sorrowful,
      disappointed intonation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have n&rsquo;t I a right to be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me, if you can, that you have n&rsquo;t cared for me a bit; not at any
      time. You see,&rdquo; he added with conviction but without triumph, &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I had ever cried&mdash;in my life&mdash;since I was a child&mdash;I
      think&mdash;I should cry now,&rdquo; she said, in little, uneven sections of
      speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marcia!&rdquo; All the anger passed away from Jem, leaving him shaken. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
      feel that way. What has happened? What have I done to change you toward
      me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot tell you&mdash;more than I have told you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Try,&rdquo; he urged. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have it out!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not clever at explaining. Not&mdash;not such things as this. There
      is something that rises up inside and&mdash;and forbids. Oh, Jem! You must
      know, without my putting it into words.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s that cursed Wade story, of course. But that&rsquo;s because you don&rsquo;t
      understand. Surely, between you and me a&mdash;a petty little matter such
      as that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Petty!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Marcia, it&rsquo;s just part of the day&rsquo;s work. Ask any newspaper man. Ask
      Andrew Galpin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who has perhaps half-spoiled his life by defending his friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s different&mdash;I&rsquo;d have done that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you believe that of me, Marcia? Do you think I&rsquo;m a coward?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Falsehood is always cowardly,&rdquo; she said very low. &ldquo;Perhaps I am abnormal
      about it. I cannot help it. I was bred that way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But try to be fair to me,&rdquo; he pleaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fair to you? I was more than that. I could not believe that you had
      written it. When I went into Eli Wade&rsquo;s shop that morning there was a
      strange, violent white-haired little man there with him&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nick Milliken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. He said what&mdash;what you have said; that it was all part of the
      day&rsquo;s work; that you were no worse than any other reporter. He said that
      you had boasted to him that nobody could control your pen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy groaned. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then he laughed, and said things about you that I would not endure to
      hear&mdash;as I told him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You defended me against Milliken!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tried to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you defend me against yourself, Marcia?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He could hear her long, slow-drawn breath before she answered. &ldquo;I could
      defend you against <i>yourself</i>, in my own heart. But I cannot defend
      the ideal of you that I had built up, against what you have done to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could n&rsquo;t you have told me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Told you what, Jem?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I did represent an ideal to you..Think what it would have meant to
      me to&mdash;to know that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Something told him that she was smiling in the darkness and that there was
      pain and pity as well as a sweet mockery in the smile. &ldquo;Could I tell you
      that before you told me&mdash;what you have told me to-night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I love you? You can&rsquo;t pretend that you did n&rsquo;t know it. But I&rsquo;d no
      business to tell you then: I&rsquo;ve no business to tell you now,&rdquo; he added
      gloomily. &ldquo;What have I got to offer a girl like you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would not matter,&rdquo; she answered him proudly. &ldquo;It is the other that
      matters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wade, again! I can&rsquo;t see that it matters so much, even to him. How was I
      to guess that it would hurt a simple-minded old dreamer of that sort?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you been to see him since?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The direct query had the stunning force of accusation. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; he
      said dully. &ldquo;I knew all the time it was a rotten thing to do, only I would
      n&rsquo;t face it. And I&rsquo;ve kept away from the Boot &amp; Shoe Infirmary because
      I was afraid to go there. It&rsquo;s curious,&rdquo; he added, in a flat, detached
      manner of speech, &ldquo;how the little things of life&mdash;the things you
      think are little&mdash;wreck the whole business for you, when it&rsquo;s too
      late to do anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jem!&rdquo; gasped the girl. &ldquo;I cannot bear to hear you talk so. It&mdash;it is
      unlike you. It hurts me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to hurt you, dear, Heaven knows. I only want to get this
      clear. You&mdash;you think I&rsquo;m unfit to be&mdash;that I&rsquo;m untrustworthy.
      Is that it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I being very cruel?&rdquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve answered. It&rsquo;s the truth that&rsquo;s cruel, not you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must trust. Absolutely. Or&mdash;there is nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see. When do you go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Of a sudden her strong young arms were about his shoulders; her hot, sweet
      face was pressed against his. He felt the quick throbbing of the vein in
      her temple, and was shaken to the foundations of his being with the dear
      and bewildering shock of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Jem!&rdquo; Her whisper fluttered close to his ear. &ldquo;Why do you <i>let</i>
      me go! Never let me go. It breaks my heart to go. To leave you. Never to
      see you again. Why must I go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t. You shan&rsquo;t. Marcia, darling! After this you can&rsquo;t leave me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He lifted her head to press his lips upon her eyes. They were hot and dry.
      But when he sought her mouth, her quick hand interposed. As abruptly as
      she had come into his arms she escaped their jealous clasp and stood back
      from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How could I!&rdquo; she panted. &ldquo;It was unfair of me. I never meant it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t tell me that&mdash;now,&rdquo; he answered, with a new note of joy
      and triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was wrong&mdash;so wrong,&rdquo; she mourned. &ldquo;It did not mean what&mdash;what
      you hoped. For I must go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go?&rdquo; he repeated incredulously. &ldquo;And not come back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, <i>want</i> me to come back, Jem!&rdquo; she pleaded. &ldquo;Keep wanting me to
      come back. If anything could ever bring me, that would. But it will not.
      Nothing can. I know it. I am holding to a dream.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve lost mine,&rdquo; said Jem. &ldquo;And everything in life with it&mdash;if you
      go, now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me. And believe that I never meant to hurt you. If I have, it was
      my ignorance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ignorance? You? I wish I could see your face now, to see how wise it is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are smiling at me again,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But I am not wise. I am very
      foolish. And I am very young. Jem, do you know how old I am?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes I&rsquo;ve thought you must be at least a hundred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not eighteen yet, Jem. Indeed, I am not. I once told you that I was
      old, as a child. So you must forgive me and believe me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do anything but give you up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That, too,&rdquo; she said very low. She set her hand trustfully within his
      arm. &ldquo;Come. You must take me home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a silent walk; the girl full of musings; the man of a grim, dogged
      determination. At the rose-bowered steps he took her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be here directly I finish my work. No; I&rsquo;ve
      got one errand I must do first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; she asked wanly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to see Eli Wade.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I am glad,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped for a moment at the gate, hoping for another sight of her. She
      had turned up the hall light and now stood in the doorway, beneath the
      roses. Her face was inexpressibly wistful, inexpressibly lovely,
      inexpressibly lonely. The subtle and changeful eyes stared widely into the
      darkness. Suddenly she threw her arm across them with a desolate,
      renunciatory gesture and turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shoes which Eli Wade had repaired for Jeremy Robson were leaden-soled
      to carry home a leaden and foreboding heart, that night.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      With the new day came new courage to the lover. Marcia cared for him, by
      her own tacit confession. After all, his fault had been a minor one; there
      was sound defense for it: he could convince her of that, and overbear her
      intention of leaving him. What he failed to perceive was this: that the
      girl was concerned, not with a fault, but with a flaw of character divined
      by her subtle and powerful intuition. But a world without Marcia Ames was
      unthinkable to young Jeremy Robson, considering the prospect calmly in the
      light of day; and being unthinkable, there remained only to devise the
      best means of combating her illogical and even&mdash;he would go thus far&mdash;unfair
      judgment of himself. Growing more assured and comfortable in his mind, as
      the day wore on, he contrived to finish up his work early, and left the
      office at a jubilant skip, intent on getting to Montgomery Street with the
      least possible delay. He was n&rsquo;t even going by way of the Boot &amp; Shoe
      Infirmary. Eli Wade could wait.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the sidewalk he was accosted by young Burton Higman, who glanced
      sidelong at him out of ashamed-looking, swollen eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cut it short, Buddy,&rdquo; said the hasting Jem.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s gone,&rdquo; said the small boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jem stopped dead in his tracks. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s gone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Marcy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where? When?&rdquo; demanded Jem wildly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chicago. Three-thirty-seven,&rdquo; returned the precise Buddy.
    </p>
    <p>
      A pall of dimness settled down over the glaring street; hot, stark,
      sterile dimness through which the figures of trivial folk moved lifelessly
      on futile errands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did she leave any message?&rdquo; inquired Jem, presently, in a voice which
      would have been life-like from a phonograph.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Told me to tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did she go&mdash;so soon?&rdquo; The query was put, not to young Mr. Higman
      but to a blind and juggernaut providence.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was young Mr. Higman, however, who responded. &ldquo;Afraid,&rdquo; he stated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Afraid? What of?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Herself. She told me so when she k-k-kissed me goodbye.&rdquo; Buddy&rsquo;s eyes
      winked rapidly. &ldquo;But she didn&rsquo;t tell me to tell you that,&rdquo; he reflected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did she give you any other message?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not exac&rsquo;ly a message.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on! Out with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You need n&rsquo;t <i>bite</i> a feller,&rdquo; expostulated young Mr. Higman. &ldquo;She
      told me if ever you got what you was after, to go to you an&rsquo; ast for a
      job, when I needed it, for the sake of a mut&mdash;mut&mdash;some kind of
      friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jem registered a silent and pious vow. &ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Do I get the job?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I can give it to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, Mr. Robson. I guess she meant you was that kind of friend. Are you a
      friend of hern?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jem got it out at last: &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Young Mr. Higman&rsquo;s eyes became suddenly more strained and ashamed-looking.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to miss her somethin&rsquo; awful, Mr. Robson,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
       But Mr. Robson had passed on. Buddy wondered whether he had suffered a
      touch of the sun. He seemed uncertain in his walk.

      CHAPTER VIII
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>N the course of a
      long and varied life, Miss Editha Greer had been consistently eccentric.
      In the close of it she was not less so. Witness the following telegram
      received by her great-nephew, Jeremy Robson:
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Philadelphia, July 30, 1912</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>I am dead. Do not come to funeral. Letter follows.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>E. Greer.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      To say that the recipient of this posthumous message was overcome with
      grief, would be excessive. His feeling for his aged relative had been one
      of mild and remote piety, relieved by an intermittent sense of amusement,
      and impregnated with a vague dread of what she might do next. No more next
      now for E. Greer. Jeremy was honestly sorry; not on his own account, but
      for the old lady herself. She had so enjoyed life! Doubtless she had
      relinquished it with courage; but, also, he felt certain, with profound
      dissent from the verdict. But, having duly dismissed him from
      consideration in her lifetime, what should she be writing him about now
      that she was dead?
    </p>
    <p>
      Like the telegram, the letter, when it arrived, proved to be an
      anticipatory document. It dealt, in a frank and unflattering style, with
      Jeremy&rsquo;s expectations upon her property which, she observed
      characteristically, was much less than most fools supposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>I have long considered you a bit of a ninny [continued this pleasing
      document]. Nor have I valid cause to alter my opinion. But I recently met
      at a country house a young woman who knows you. [Jeremy&rsquo;s heart performed
      a porpoise-roll within his breast.] She tells me that I am an old fool. I
      interpret her expression and bearing, not her words, which are that I do
      not understand you. Apparently she believes that she does. If I left you
      all my money, she would perhaps marry you for it. On the whole, however, I
      believe not. She has neglected much more brilliant opportunities here.
      Moreover, when I put the question to her, she said not. She added that I
      was impertinent, and that impertinence was no more tolerable from the old
      to the young than from the young to the old. I like your Miss Marcia Ames.
      </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      The point of importance is that she considers the modest, in fact I may
      say nominal and complimentary, sum set apart for you in my will, quite
      insufficient. We discussed it at length. She is possessed of a devil of
      frankness. She maintains that I should leave you a modest competency. She
      thinks that it might save your immortal soul, if I correctly interpret her
      attitude. She thinks your immortal soul is worth saving. She assumes that
      you have an immortal soul. She even appeared to think that I have an
      immortal soul. Upon that moot point I shall be better able to judge by the
      time this letter goes forward to you; but it is improbable that I shall
      communicate any further or more authoritative information.
    </p>
    <p>
      She is a strange creature. You should have married her, though she is far
      too old for you. A hundred years at least. I judge you might have married
      her but lost your chance. [Here the reader groaned.] She might have made a
      success of you. I gravely doubt whether my money can.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do not hastily assume that the money is within your grasp. There is a
      condition to be fulfilled. I believe that you will not fulfill it. She
      believes that you will, even though she does not know what it is. Nor
      shall you. Whether you receive a small pittance or a roundly comfortable
      sum, depends now entirely upon yourself. I am still malicious enough&mdash;I
      forget that I am now, as you read this, dead and safely buried&mdash;I was
      still malicious enough to wish that I might see your struggles of mind
      upon receiving this, the last communication wherewith you will ever be
      troubled from
    </p>
    <p>
      Your dutiful great-aunt,
    </p>
    <p>
      E. Greer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perturbation over the prospect of comparative enrichment was quite
      subordinated, as Jeremy read this curious epistle, to the turbulence of
      emotion excited by the knowledge that Marcia had been interesting herself
      so intimately in his affairs. So far, the joke turned against Great-Aunt
      Greer. But she was more than avenged by the sting in her surmise that Jem
      had forfeited his chance with Marcia. Where was Marcia? If he got the
      money, or the assurance of it, why should he not set out to find her, even
      though it took him across the world, and try once more? Would she have the
      force to escape from him again? Was not her flight the initial confession,
      upon which her queer relations with E. Greer set the seal? Only as an
      afterthought came the consideration of the condition upon which he was to
      secure the larger legacy. He could not seem to get excited or disturbed
      over it. Nothing mattered much in the bleak soul of Jeremy Robson but
      Marcia Ames. Great-Aunt Greer would have been sorely disgusted! Or,
      perhaps she would n&rsquo;t.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three days thereafter a caller came to see Jeremy at The Record office.
      His card indicated that he was Mr. Arthur Welton, representing the firm of
      Hunt &amp; Hunt, Attorneys, Philadelphia. His appearance indicated that he
      was about Jeremy&rsquo;s age. His bearing indicated that he was older than
      Pharaoh&rsquo;s uncle, and charged with world-destinies. Jeremy had a shrewd
      guess that this was his first mission away from home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Welton looked Jeremy over minutely and shook hands. The firm of Hunt
      &amp; Hunt, which he had the honor to represent, had charge of the affairs
      of Miss Editha Greer, deceased, he informed Mr. Robson. Would Mr. Robson
      kindly put on his coat?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you want me to go out with you?&rdquo; asked Jeremy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you prefer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with this? Nobody will interrupt us here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well.&rdquo; The age-old youth wrapped himself in an air of superior
      expectancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go ahead,&rdquo; said the reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The coat,&rdquo; reminded Mr. Welton.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy was annoyed. &ldquo;Why the devil should I put on a coat with the mercury
      ramping around 90?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A mere formality,&rdquo; murmured his visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, very well!&rdquo; growled Jeremy. He departed and presently returned, fully
      and uncomfortably garmented.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Mr. Arthur Welton inspected him carefully. &ldquo;You do not wear
      mourning, I observe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do <i>not</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not, may I ask?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t believe in it. It&rsquo;s a pagan custom and usually hypocritical.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot agree with you,&rdquo; retorted the other weightily. &ldquo;On principle, I
      cannot agree with you. In the present instance, would it be an evidence of
      hypocrisy to have shown a formal mark of sorrow for the loss of your
      great-aunt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You felt, then, no affection or esteem for the late Miss Editha Greer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What business is that of yours?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is so much the business of my firm that I have traveled a thousand
      miles to ascertain your attitude.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The condition!&rdquo; cried Jeremy, aloud. &ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;If
      you had told me that this was a legal cross-examination&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not precisely that, Mr. Robson. I should have thought that you would
      appreciate its purport,&rdquo; returned the other in a tone of grave rebuke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do.&rdquo; There was a grim set to the other&rsquo;s lips. &ldquo;I know Aunt Edie well
      enough to appreciate her practical jokes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, Mr. Robson! I am bound to protest against the assumption that our
      late client&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right! All right! I withdraw it. Fire ahead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Arthur Weston looked delicately but impressively pained. &ldquo;You felt no
      affection or esteem for the deceased?&rdquo; he inquired through pursed lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I liked the old lady, in a way,&rdquo; confessed Jeremy reminiscently. &ldquo;She had
      such a cheery spice of the devil in her. And her tongue! And her pen! Oh,
      Lord! What an editorial writer she&rsquo;d have made, if she could have kept out
      of jail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I need hardly tell you, Mr. Robson, that she gravely disapproved of your
      journalistic predilections.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody need tell me after she got through. Nobody need tell anybody
      anything that my Great-Aunt Greer had told &rsquo;em first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In order that the record may be clear, let me put this to you. It is
      admitted that you disapprove of symbolical mourning; that you do not
      practice it. If you did practice it, would you have worn mourning for the
      deceased Miss Greer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the dog had n&rsquo;t stopped to scratch the flea would he have caught the
      rabbit?&rdquo; retorted the irreverent Mr. Robson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must insist upon a reply.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I certainly shouldn&rsquo;t. Why should I? I&rsquo;m not grieving over Aunt
      Edie&rsquo;s death. She&rsquo;s no real loss to me. Nor gain, either, now,&rdquo; he added
      with a rueful grin. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to pretend. So, you see, there&rsquo;s not
      even a mitigating circumstance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mitigating circ&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good legal phrase, is n&rsquo;t it? Oh, I understand your errand perfectly.
      Aunt Edie wrote me that there was a &lsquo;condition&rsquo; to the legacy that I would
      n&rsquo;t fulfill. If you&rsquo;d come out here and found me all swathed up in black
      like a mummy, and with a funereal gulp in my voice when I spoke of my dear
      old Auntie, and the general manners of an undertaker right on the job, I
      expect it might have been worth twenty or twenty-five thousand dollars to
      me. Even a mourning band on my coat and a few appropriate sighs in the
      right place might have got me five or ten thousand. Maybe if I&rsquo;d stopped
      to figure it out, I&rsquo;d have dressed the part. A fellow will do a good deal
      for money. Then again, maybe I would n&rsquo;t.&rdquo; The memory of Marcia&rsquo;s frank
      and lustrous eyes checked him. Could he have met their challenge, with the
      black badge of hypocrisy on him? &ldquo;No! I&rsquo;m damned if I would!&rdquo; he declared
      with profound sincerity. &ldquo;So there you have it. I know where I get off,
      and I don&rsquo;t much care, to tell the truth. I lose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The overweighted legal victim of responsibilities almost too heavy to be
      borne, slowly and accurately gathered up his hat, his gloves, his cane,
      his portfolio, and his eye-glasses in the absorbed manner of one taking an
      inventory. He bowed a solemn and professional farewell to Mr. Robson. At
      the door he paused. A gleam as of some faint, inward flickering of the
      eternal human which must at times assert itself even through the cerements
      of legal procedure, appeared upon his pink and careworn features.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he pronounced profoundly. &ldquo;You win.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>

      CHAPTER IX
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>HAT &rsquo;s the
      matter with you, Robson?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Young Jeremy Robson turned a lack-luster eye upon Wackley, his managing
      editor. &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; he said listlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not looking well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m all right,&rdquo; said the reporter, dully wishing his solicitous
      superior at the devil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Want a few days off to go fishin&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thanks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; inquired Wackley, dreading to hear that a raise of pay
      was the requisite. Cheered by the valuable reporter&rsquo;s negative declaration
      of content with his lot as it was, the editor continued: &ldquo;A sick owl is a
      merry wag to what you&rsquo;ve been for the last ten days. All the ginger has
      gone out of your stuff. Can&rsquo;t you dig us up something more as good as your
      Eli Wade story?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In that moment Jeremy Robson savored the sensations of the chicken-killing
      puppy when, awaking from blessedly forgetful reverie, it finds the dismal
      and penal relic of its crime still fast about its neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; pursued Wackley. &ldquo;This is n&rsquo;t going to do. You quit for the
      day, and go home. To-morrow there&rsquo;s going to be doings in the Senate.
      Martin Embree is going to spring something. You cover it. We&rsquo;ll want a
      good story, if the stuff comes through. Beat it for home, now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Home? Young Jeremy Robson felt a loathly distaste for his quiet room up
      off the campus. But so he felt a loathly distaste for the whole of that
      hollow and lifeless shell about him, which had so lately been the world of
      his crowded, vigorous interests. Man delighted him not; no, nor woman,
      either; not even the pride of his work and his satisfaction in having
      become something of a figure, though in a minor degree, locally. He
      hungered, with the intensity of a self-willed and rather lonely nature,
      for the sight and sound and essence of Marcia Ames who was some weeks and
      Heaven only knew how many miles away from him. Young Jeremy Robson had
      suffered as severe a hurt as youth can suffer and still continue to be
      youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wandered idly up the Nicklin Avenue hill and turned into the shaded
      sweetness of Montgomery Street. Miss Letitia Pritchard was at her
      hedge-row, cutting roses. She was a placid and vigorous mite of a woman,
      unfaded at fifty, sweet and hardy and fresh-hued and rugged like a late,
      frost-resisting apple.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How hot and tired you look!&rdquo; was her greeting across the barrier of bloom
      and fragrance. &ldquo;Come in and I&rsquo;ll give you some iced ginger-and-lemon.&rdquo; She
      led the way to a dwarfish table in a fairy grotto of rocks and climbing
      flowers. &ldquo;Are you never coming to see me any more?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you&rsquo;d care to have me,&rdquo; he replied, exactly like a forlorn
      small boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your rival, Buddy Higman, comes every day. Though that&rsquo;s partly business.
      But he always starts in by asking, &lsquo;Heard from Her, again, Miss Letty?&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her visitor gave her a grateful look. &ldquo;What do you hear, Miss Pritchard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My young and dangerous cousin is dashing about New York at a great rate,&rdquo;
       she informed him, &ldquo;enjoying life to the utmost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then she has n&rsquo;t sailed yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She sails in a fortnight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does she say anything about coming back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The rosy spinster shook her head. &ldquo;Not a word. But then, Marcia does n&rsquo;t
      say things. She does &rsquo;em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think she will come back&mdash;some time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably not. I think she will&mdash;well, do what is best for her.
      Without being at all a selfish person, Marcia has a singular instinct for
      doing what is best for herself. In the real sense, I mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Undoubtedly! reflected young Mr. Jeremy Robson. She had done the best
      thing for herself in judging him and finding him lacking. Acceptance of
      which fact gave to his face an expression which caused Miss Pritchard to
      look the other way. Presently she went to a shelf in the nook and brought
      out an envelope which she placed in her caller&rsquo;s hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are n&rsquo;t they good!&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      He smoothed out the curving paper, and Marcia&rsquo;s own face smiled forth its
      quaint and inscrutable witchery at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I took it the day before she went away. There&rsquo;s one to spare,&rdquo; she
      suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think she&rsquo;d want me to have it?&rdquo; he asked, his hungry gaze set
      upon the little print.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a nice boy,&rdquo; said Miss Letitia Pritchard. (&ldquo;And all the nicer,&rdquo;
       she thought to herself, &ldquo;for being so much a boy.&rdquo;) &ldquo;Yes; she&rsquo;d be glad to
      have you have it, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She did n&rsquo;t say so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sympathy for the eagerness of his tone softened the old maid&rsquo;s smile. &ldquo;No.
      She did n&rsquo;t say so. She did n&rsquo;t say anything about you, except that you&rsquo;d
      come to see me. For a time I thought her prophecy was wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to come again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As often as you like,&rdquo; she said kindly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re one of three people she
      talked to me about, the night before she left. The others were Buddy&mdash;she
      is going to help him get an education when the time comes&mdash;and Eli
      Wade.&rdquo; From day to day Jeremy had postponed the dreaded confessional visit
      to the Boot &amp; Shoe Surgeon. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve reminded me of an errand, Miss
      Pritchard,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bidding her good-bye, he went direct to the Infirmary. The old
      practitioner sat hunched over a pair of white buckskins. He lifted a mild,
      but questioning face to Jeremy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in, Mr. Robson,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite some time sence you was here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was ashamed to come,&rdquo; blurted Jeremy..
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shucks! Don&rsquo;t say that. You can&rsquo;t be responsible for what they order you
      to write. That&rsquo;s a reporter&rsquo;s job.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who says so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nick Milliken. He says any reporter &rsquo;d have to do the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was a bitter flavoring to the dose. &ldquo;That is n&rsquo;t so,&rdquo; replied Jeremy
      quietly. &ldquo;I need n&rsquo;t have written it; not that way. I need n&rsquo;t have
      written it at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Boot &amp; Shoe Surgeon set down the subject upon which he was
      operating. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; he said, puzzled and despondent. &ldquo;Did you
      want to do it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is n&rsquo;t the question. I did n&rsquo;t have to do it. If necessary I could
      have resigned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man&rsquo;s face cleared up. &ldquo;Quit your job? That&rsquo;d &rsquo;a&rsquo; been
      foolish. There was n&rsquo;t any call for you to do that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anyhow I&rsquo;m mighty sorry I ever touched the story. And if I&rsquo;d known what
      it was going to do to you&rdquo;&mdash;The old man flinched involuntarily at
      this reference to the dead glories of his School Board incumbency&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;d
      never have touched it in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure you would! You&rsquo;d do it again. To-morrow if the orders came.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jem whirled to meet the malevolent smile of Nicholas Milliken, the
      Socialist, standing in the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you not to blame this young feller,&rdquo; the newcomer bade Eli Wade.
      &ldquo;He can&rsquo;t help it. He&rsquo;s only a louse-souled ratchet in the machinery of
      the capitalistic press.&rdquo; Obviously much pleased with this rich metaphor,
      Mr. Milliken entered and seated himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I knew he wouldn&rsquo;t do it to me a-purpose,&rdquo; said Eli Wade.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy Robson felt sick; too sick even to be incensed at Milliken who
      proceeded:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did n&rsquo;t even know the little game they were playing, did you, young
      feller? Well, you see, Eli, here, he&rsquo;s a radical as far as his
      intelligence will carry him. That&rsquo;s my influence on him. The bosses don&rsquo;t
      want radicals on the School Board. They don&rsquo;t want &rsquo;em anywhere.
      Anyhow the Schools belong to the Germans: that&rsquo;s their specialty. So, Eli
      being against the cultural-extension-of-German plan, they stir up the
      Germans against him, and then sick the newspapers onto him, and when they
      sick, <i>you</i> do the yapping. That&rsquo;s all there is to <i>that</i>.
      Except that Smiling Mart, the damned hypocrite, steps up and eases Eli out
      to help put in another German and clinch his hold on a few more German
      votes. Not that it ain&rsquo;t all right, at that; if they&rsquo;ll put in a good
      radical. The cultural extension&rsquo;s good enough, like anything else that&rsquo;ll
      help people <i>think</i>. Oh, these fools! They can&rsquo;t see education is
      what&rsquo;s going to dish &rsquo;em all and bring on the Social Revolution.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you talk against Martin Embree, Nick,&rdquo; admonished the proprietor.
      &ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t a straighter set pair o&rsquo; feet in the State of Centralia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. Then I&rsquo;m a goat; look at my hoofs!&rdquo; grinned the Socialist.
      &ldquo;But be patient with our helpless young hired-man writer here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy liked Milliken&rsquo;s contemptuous excusals less than Wade&rsquo;s blame, and
      said so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you ain&rsquo;t reached the bottom of your ditch yet,&rdquo; jeered the
      Socialist. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s the editorial end? Still writing &rsquo;em?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Jeremy shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pot of ink; pot o&rsquo; glue; pot o&rsquo; soft soap and a pair of blinders; there&rsquo;s
      your editorial-writer&rsquo;s outfit. Done any slush-bucketing for Montrose
      Clark yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say it as though you did n&rsquo;t expect to. But you will. Oh, yes; you&rsquo;ll
      come to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him be, Nick,&rdquo; said the gentle old philosopher of foot-garb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he let you be? Let him listen. One day old Judge Slippery Selden Dana
      will come puttering into The Record office&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the ball of his sole,&rdquo; put in the Boot &amp; Shoe Surgeon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pussyfooting. <i>Of</i> course. He&rsquo;ll suggest to Mr. Farley; that some
      recognition of Mr. Montrose Clark&rsquo;s eminent services as a citizen would be
      timely. Know what that means? Means that Puffy Clark and the P.-U. Co. are
      getting ready to grab another franchise. Does Mr. Farley see it that way?
      He does! He remembers a little slice of P.-U. stock in the strong-box. And
      if Young Feller, here, is good enough with his pen, he wins the job of
      puffery for the puffiest little public-utility-grafting puff-adder that
      ever stung a city. And will <i>he</i> see it that way? He will. He&rsquo;ll
      remember his little pay envelope at the end of the week, and he&rsquo;ll come
      through. It&rsquo;s a grand little system.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing wrong with a system that lets a man get from his employees what
      he pays for,&rdquo; defended Jeremy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing wrong with your cutting Eli Wade&rsquo;s throat to order, either. Eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To this Jeremy found no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remember that apology I was going to make on demand? Do I hear any
      demand? I guess the apology&rsquo;s the other way around.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve made it. Not to you, though. I&rsquo;m going on. Eli! Once more I&rsquo;m sorry
      and I&rsquo;m ashamed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Until next time,&rdquo; added the irrepressible malice of the white-haired
      Socialist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not trusting himself to reply, the reporter walked out. Within a few
      strides Milliken was at his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s bad hurt, the old boy,&rdquo; he confided in a wholly altered and wholly
      sincere tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Oh, your story is only part of it. Clever! Vur-ree clever. But they&rsquo;d
      have got his place on the Board anyway. They needed it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can I do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing. Unless,&rdquo; added the other on reflection, &ldquo;you could slip
      something pleasant about him over some time. That&rsquo;d please him. He&rsquo;s like
      a child, about print.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At home Jem took out the picture of Marcia Ames and studied it. Tiny
      though it was, it was instinct with her very poise and spiritual
      effluence. As so often with herself, he felt the something unsaid behind
      the serene self-possession of the face; the something vital for which he
      must grope. What was the message, the demand which the face was making
      upon him, which she was making upon him through this dear memento? Ranging
      back, he recalled in a flash that first impression of her in the meeting,
      while she was still so completely unknown that he had mistaken even the
      fundamental matter of sex; the impression of an untouched, untainted
      valorousness. Again he saw it, reflected from the tiny delicacy of the
      picture. Plain enough now what she demanded of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was courage.

      CHAPTER X
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE Senate
      proceedings did not open until ten o&rsquo;clock. Meantime Montrose Clark,
      President of the Fenchester Public Utilities Corporation, and in some part
      godling of local affairs, had telephoned his commands to The Record that a
      representative be sent to his office that morning to take a statement for
      the paper. Jeremy, incautiously dropping in at the office early, got the
      job to do before going to the Capitol. He was admitted to an outer office
      by the hand-perfected private secretary, cross-questioned briefly, and
      passed in to the Presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Montrose Clark was telephoning. He was revealed to Jeremy&rsquo;s inquiring
      eye as a plump, glossy, red-faced little man with a fussily assured
      manner, an autocratic voice and a keen and greedy eye. Few indeed were the
      local pies of promise or flavor in which Mr. Clark did not have a pudgy
      and profit-taking finger; and his bearing suggested the man comfortably
      sure of taking care of himself. He snapped &ldquo;G&rsquo;-bye&rdquo; into the telephone and
      turned to Jeremy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the rippawtah from The Record?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The accent of the word stirred Jeremy&rsquo;s bile. He did not know that it was
      merely a sub-conscious stock trick of Mr. Clark&rsquo;s; that there were certain
      words, such as &ldquo;rippawtah,&rdquo; &ldquo;culchah,&rdquo; &ldquo;legislaychuh,&rdquo; and the like,
      whereby he asserted his superiority of intellectual status, reverting to
      the comfortable speech of the Middle West for the communication of other
      thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m from The Record,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take this.&rdquo; The public-utilitarian began to dictate....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Got that? Be sure to be accurate. This is important.&rdquo; To the reporter it
      seemed neither important nor interesting. It was a statement concerning a
      projected change, petty, administrative, and technical, in the conduct of
      the trolley system. Had it been of the most vital significance, the
      &ldquo;rippawtah&rdquo; would still have grilled at the impersonal arrogance of the
      other&rsquo;s attitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Got that?&rdquo; repeated Mr. Clark, after another passage. &ldquo;Read it over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy laid down his pencil. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think you&rsquo;d better send for one of
      your stenographers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for?&rdquo; demanded the other. &ldquo;A rippawtah ought to be able to take
      dictation, if he&rsquo;s competent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A &lsquo;rippawtah,&rsquo; as you call him, is accustomed to a certain degree of
      courtesy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Montrose Clark pressed a button and his hand-perfected private
      secretary popped in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Garson! Call The Record. Tell Farley to instruct his rippawtah to follow
      directions and not be insolent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Red to his cheek-bones, Jeremy tore up the sheet of paper on which he had
      been writing, dropped the pieces upon the immaculate rug of the outraged
      Mr. Montrose Clark, and marched out. Straight to The Record office he went
      and sought Wackley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can have my job. I&rsquo;m through.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; asked the astonished and alarmed managing editor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy told him. Wackley laughed. He had no intention of losing so
      valuable a man as Robson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Between us, Montrose Clark is an ass,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let him bother
      you. We&rsquo;ll keep you away from his jobs after this. Anyway, we&rsquo;re going to
      work you into editorials and specials more, from now on. Trot along now to
      the Capitol, and keep your eye on Mart Embree.&rdquo; Anticipation was in the
      air of the Senate Chamber when Jeremy arrived. Something special was
      expected from Senator Embree. As always, when he was on the programme, the
      galleries were full. There was reason and precedent for this, for the two
      local newspapers were wont to report the leader of the Northern Tier in a
      cautious, not to say niggardly manner. People who wished to savor the full
      acidity of the young radical&rsquo;s utterances, would best get seats for
      themselves, or be dependent upon more provident friends for word-of-mouth
      synopsis of the proceedings, since the unfortunate instance of the famous
      &ldquo;Piracy and the P.-U.&rdquo; speech on the Special Condemnation Bill, in which
      Senator Embree had held up that civic godling, Mr. Montrose Clark, to the
      scorn and reprehension of the impious rabble, and the local press had
      published the whole matter. Politicians had confidently declared that the
      speech would terminate the public life of Smiling Mart, who, by the way,
      had smiled only twice in the whole course of his effort, once at the
      beginning and again at the end. Montrose Clark, they said, would be too
      strong for him. It did not so appear. When the tumult and the shouting had
      died and the captains of industry and the kings of local politics had
      departed and laid their plans for the elimination of the upstart, it
      transpired that the upstart had by that one speech crystallized a somewhat
      indefinite policy of progressive radicalism into a compaign for the rescue
      of the State from the control of the financial and public utility magnates
      who had quietly taken it over from an older and far more corrupt purely
      political management. The man in the street rallied to Martin Embree, as
      well where the street was a country town thoroughfare as where it was a
      city&rsquo;s artery of trade, and the farmers of the north followed almost in a
      body and without much respect to party. These were unassimilated
      Americans; Scandinavians, a few Dutch and Italians, but mostly Germans.
      Martin Embree had the unbounded confidence of these elements, particularly
      the Germans. He had cultivated it assiduously, and by legitimate political
      methods. In and out of season he impressed them with their responsibility
      for the cleansing of politics, and for reform. Now, to your
      German-American, uplifted in the conviction of racial righteousness,
      reform is a word sanctified for his own uses. Reform means compelling
      other people to think as he thinks. Therefore he solemnly adopts it.
      Reform, to these Northern Tier farmers, meant Martin Embree. By this
      support alone, if he had enjoyed no other, he was too strong for the
      powers that were completely to dislodge. He was clean, honest, earnest,
      fervent, laborious, and the possessor of a direct and winning address. Too
      late, the &ldquo;old gang&rdquo; perceived that he had developed from a &ldquo;cheap
      spellbinder&rdquo; into a &ldquo;dangerous demagogue&rdquo;; and largely because they had so
      ill-advisedly permitted such part of the press as they controlled, to
      disseminate that telling speech of his. At least, they would n&rsquo;t make that
      mistake again! Martin Embree was now too considerable a figure to be
      ignored in print. But no other man in the public life of Centralia was so
      rigorously &ldquo;edited.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To-day, Jeremy Robson foresaw, his own job would be one of reporting
      orally, rather than writing. This acting as political lookout he quite
      enjoyed; it gave him a flattering sense of being on the inside of things.
      Then, too, there was opportunity for finesse. If the speaker of the day
      got upon slippery ground, Jeremy would have his chance to trip him up
      editorially, perhaps. He knew that Embree would not resent this in him. It
      was part of the game, in which they were, for the present, opponents. The
      Senator&rsquo;s good-humor and broad-minded acceptance of the matter was one of
      the qualities which Jeremy most ardently admired in him. And politically
      he was so right and decent and clear of vision! What would not Jeremy have
      given for a chance as political expert on a paper supporting Embree&rsquo;s main
      policies, a progressive and independent paper such as the Bellair Journal,
      for example! Perhaps that would come in time; already The Journal had
      offered him a reporter&rsquo;s job. Meanwhile he must, in fairness, be loyal to
      his employers. Embree himself would admit that. Any one would admit it,
      except a hare-brained Socialist like Milliken. Jeremy clung to that
      justification of loyalty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Routine business was still in progress on the floor when Galpin of The
      Guardian came in and seated himself next to Jeremy. There was still a
      patch over his left eye. His broad and bony face wore, an expression of
      concerned expectation. .
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s Embree after this time?&rdquo; Jeremy whispered to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Us,&rdquo; said Galpin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Editorial &lsquo;we&rsquo;? The Guardian? How?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know. Can&rsquo;t pick up much. Martin don&rsquo;t ever say much beforehand.
      Pulls his gun and shoots.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Lord help the bull&rsquo;s-eye!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay-ah,&rdquo; assented Galpin. &ldquo;I asked him this morning what&rsquo;s what, and all
      he said was; &lsquo;Better get ready to duck in the Press Gallery,&rsquo; with that
      smile of his that may mean fun and may mean murder. Look! There&rsquo;s Slippery
      Selden Dana on the floor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That means the P.-U. is in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not necessarily. But it means something out of the ordinary. He is n&rsquo;t
      spending Montrose Clark&rsquo;s time on any picayune stuff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t blame Embree if he goes after the newspapers,&rdquo; said The Record
      reflectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fool trick, though. They always get in the last wallop.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look what a raw deal he gets, here in Fenchester. The best he gets from
      The Record is silent contempt, and The Guardian&mdash;well, I don&rsquo;t know
      why he has n&rsquo;t sued The Guardian for libel long ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;d be the use?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean The Guardian is right in practically saying he&rsquo;s a crook?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I guess he&rsquo;s the nearest decent thing we&rsquo;ve got in this rotten mess
      of politics,&rdquo; said Galpin with the experienced political reporter&rsquo;s
      cynical view of public men, &ldquo;unless it&rsquo;s Magnus Laurens.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why won&rsquo;t they give him a fair shake? I don&rsquo;t mind their going after
      him editorially. That&rsquo;s opinion. But to cut him out of the news, that gets
      my goat a little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay-ah? Well, you see, he&rsquo;s gumming our game.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What ga&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The whole, dam&rsquo;, slick, polite graft that makes the machine run so smooth
      and nice and turns out the pretty little dividends for the banks and the
      railroads and the big companies generally. Haven&rsquo;t you seen into that
      millstone yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You talk as if you were really on Embree&rsquo;s side.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay-ah. Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But The Guard&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a hired man,&rdquo; said Galpin impassively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you had a paper of your own&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be a hired man just the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who could boss you then?&rdquo; asked Jeremy in surprise. &ldquo;Same bunch that
      bosses The Record and The Guardian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could n&rsquo;t a paper be run independent of them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never has been in this town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But could n&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; persisted the other. &ldquo;Would n&rsquo;t it be fun to work on a
      paper like that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gee!&rdquo; murmured Galpin. They were like two urchins savoring a golden and
      imaginative treat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. President.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The resonant tones of Martin Embree&rsquo;s rich and effortless voice roused the
      reporters from their boyish vision. He stood tall, handsome, easy,
      confident, but his usually sunny face was grave, and he held in his hand a
      document, contrary to his custom. Before he had spoken five minutes to the
      hushed attention of floor and galleries, it became evident that his talk
      was centering and converging upon that document. His subject was the
      &ldquo;cheese check&rdquo; scandal which had roused the dairy farmers of his region to
      fury. He traced the steps whereby the commission men&rsquo;s combine had sought
      legislation which would have rendered the producer almost helpless in
      their hands, touched upon alleged bribery in the lower House, referred to
      the part which two of the Fenchester banking institutions had played
      (&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why Dana was here; Montrose Clark&rsquo;s in the banking game on the
      side,&rdquo; whispered Galpin), and continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For my own conscientious and repeated attempts to block this nefarious
      deal, I have been consistently derided as a silly reformer by one of the
      local newspapers, and denounced by the other in terms which, were
      circumstances otherwise, I should reply to by a suit for criminal libel. I
      am enabled to deal with The Fenchester Guardian, in a more effective,
      swifter, and more relevant manner. Will the clerk of the Senate kindly
      read this letter, which fell into my hands by a happy accident, and the
      authenticity of which will not be denied by its author?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The clerk of the Senate received the document with a look of interest
      unusual in his stolid official bearing. He began to read:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Editor&rsquo;s Office of The Fenchester Evening Guardian: Undated. My dear Mr.
      Dorlon:&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The date is established as of last month by the envelope,&rdquo; said Senator
      Embree.
    </p>
    <p>
      Profiting by the interruption, the clerk ran his eye swiftly through the
      one-page letter; but, instead of resuming his reading, left his place and
      carried it to the presiding officer. Their heads bent over it close
      together. A whisper passed between them. Its sibilance, though not its
      purport, could be heard through the silenced chamber. The clerk of the
      Senate turned away, not toward his desk, but toward the curtained exit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Clerk!&rdquo; Martin Embree&rsquo;s voice was not raised by the iota of a tone;
      yet it stopped the man in his tracks. &ldquo;Not one step out of my sight with
      that document.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Senator will come to order. The Senator will address himself to the
      chair,&rdquo; rebuked the President.
    </p>
    <p>
      Embree&rsquo;s arm rose, rigid as iron, until his stiffened hand pointed with
      all the menace of a weapon straight into the face of the discomposed
      presiding officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. President, I hold you responsible for the safety and integrity of
      that document. I ask you to direct the clerk to read it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read,&rdquo; said the President after a moment of hesitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>&ldquo;&lsquo;My dear Mr. Dorlon,&rsquo;&rdquo; repeated the clerk: &ldquo;&lsquo;I have yours of the 19th
      with directions for claiming the last payment from the Trust Co. Glad you
      approve the paper&rsquo;s course and are satisfied with what we have done on the
      Cheese Commission Bill. Locker and Mayne are O.K. I turned over their
      balance to them. We can whip Smith into line; Cary, Sellers, and
      Gunderson, too, in time. In the Senate we owe a great deal to&rsquo;&rdquo; (the
      clerk&rsquo;s voice faltered) &ldquo;&lsquo;Bellows&rsquo;&rdquo; (the clerk&rsquo;s name was Bellows).
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Better look after him. Let me know when you come to the Capitol. </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Yours very truly, (Signed) A. M. Wymett.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dead silence followed, in which the footsteps of the messenger returning
      the document to Senator Embree, sounded loud and hollow. Then a voice
      (unidentified) pronounced from the gallery in accents of intensest
      conviction: &ldquo;Well, I <i>am</i> damned!&rdquo; Which inspired another voice (also
      unidentified) to adjure solemnly, &ldquo;Burn this letter.&rdquo; The Senate found
      relief in nervous, shrill, tittering laughter. &ldquo;Will the papers print <i>that?</i>&rdquo;
       shouted somebody, and the presiding officer recovering, hammered
      vehemently for order.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; concluded Martin Embree, the damnatory letter raised to the
      level of his head, &ldquo;I leave to this honorable body the determination as
      between the Honorable A. M. Wymett, editor and proprietor of The
      Fenchester Guardian, and myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy turned to his fellow reporter, with questioning eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Knock-out,&rdquo; said Galpin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Criminal charge, is n&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guess so. Anyhow, it&rsquo;s good-bye Guardian. So far as Wymett&rsquo;s concerned,
      anyway. The crooked hound!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did n&rsquo;t you know he was doing their dirty work?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew he took orders. I didn&rsquo;t know he took money. We all take orders.
      You&rsquo;ll take orders when you suppress this story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can it be suppressed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s got to be. Honor of the profession and all that sort of thing. Let&rsquo;s
      get out. I want some air.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Outside they walked along for a block, before either spoke. Jeremy said:
      &ldquo;Andy, how&rsquo;s this going to affect you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know. Shut up about it, can&rsquo;t you! Talk about something else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; agreed the other cheerfully. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll talk about myself. I&rsquo;ve
      got a chance to make a change. What do you think of editorial writing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nice, soft job. If you can do it. I could n&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go to it, then. Only I would n&rsquo;t stick to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Galpin rubbed his shaggy head. &ldquo;Oh, I dunno. Too much preaching of the
      other fellow&rsquo;s doctrine, I guess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy&rsquo;s mind reverted to Milliken&rsquo;s view and he wondered how nearly the
      two agreed. Certainly between preaching and the profession to which the
      Socialist had bitterly likened editorializing, yawned the widest of gulfs.
      He stated Milliken&rsquo;s characterization.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rough stuff,&rdquo; commented Galpin. &ldquo;I guess there&rsquo;s something in it, though.
      Ay-ah. I get his point.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you would n&rsquo;t take the job?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might try it on for a while. But as a permanency&mdash;well, it seems
      to me a fellow that&rsquo;s settled down to write editorials for another man all
      his life has sort of given up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Given up? What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything. He&rsquo;s licked. Ay-ah. He&rsquo;s a beaten man. He&rsquo;s under contract to
      think another man&rsquo;s thoughts and make other folks think &rsquo;em if he
      can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are n&rsquo;t we doing that as reporters?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so much. Facts ain&rsquo;t thoughts. You can report and keep your mind
      independent. That&rsquo;s why I climb off the desk whenever I can, like to-day.
      Whew! I came near having Mr. Wymett go along with me. He was held up at
      the last minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Galpin turned into his office. Jeremy went to The Record to report to
      Wackley and was turned over to Mr. Farley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing about The Guardian can be published, of course,&rdquo; prescribed that
      diplomat, who had already been in communication with the local leaders.
      &ldquo;Give us half a column of the rest. And go light. It&rsquo;s ticklish ground.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After finishing, Jeremy went out for a long and thoughtful walk. On his
      return home he found a letter with the letterhead of Messrs. Hunt &amp;
      Hunt, Attorneys, of Philadelphia. The firm begged to inform him that, with
      due allowance for taxes and fees, he was heir, under his great-aunt&rsquo;s
      will, to the sum of $86,730.18.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>FTER listening to
      Andrew Galpin&rsquo;s verbal report upon Senator Martin Embree&rsquo;s painful and
      convincing characterization of The Guardian&rsquo;s editorial page as for sale
      to the highest bidder, backed up by discouraging details regarding
      himself, A. M. Wymett retired to his house to commune with a bottle and a
      time-table of the trains to Canada. As a man&rsquo;s house is his castle and as
      castles are not connected with a troublous and uncharitable world by wires
      of communication, he further fortified his position by cutting off the
      telephone. He then profoundly considered his prospects and as profoundly
      misliked them.
    </p>
    <p>
      As befitted the owner of a pliable daily, Mr. Wymett was thoroughly
      conversant with the law bearing upon publications. It seemed unpleasantly
      probable to him that his ill-fated letter laid him open to indictment on
      any one of three counts. That smiling Mart Embree would push for criminal
      action, he had little doubt. The Guardian unhappily had nothing on the
      Senator; he could n&rsquo;t be blackmailed. If the financial and political
      powers in control would stand by, The Guardian could weather the storm,
      albeit severely battered in reputation. But would they? Could they afford
      to in view of the definite nature of the exposure? Mr. Wymett supped
      gloomily and alone with this question and afterward took it into his study
      with him for the evening&rsquo;s speculation. His long, grave, immobile, ascetic
      face grew longer, graver, more immobile, and more ascetic as the facts in
      their bearing upon him massed a formidable array of cons against a
      scraggly and wavering handful of pros.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon him thus absorbed, and steadily absorbing (for the bottle was still
      his counselor), intruded young Robson of The Record.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing to say for publication,&rdquo; snapped Wymett, professionally shocked
      at the idea of his rival&rsquo;s making capital of his misfortunes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not printing anything,&rdquo; pleasantly replied his visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you sell The Guardian?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To whom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wymett leaned back from his desk and studied his caller from beneath
      heavy eyelids. His posture lent to his face a furtively benevolent look as
      of one meditating the performance of a good deed on the sly. Such was not
      his precise intent, as regarded young Robson. He didn&rsquo;t trust young
      Robson. He did n&rsquo;t trust The Record. For that matter he was not in a mood
      to trust anybody or anything in a calumnious world. He opened a small
      cabinet at his elbow which he had hastily closed upon young Robson&rsquo;s
      entrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I offer you a drink?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good! Nothing mixes so badly with printer&rsquo;s ink,&rdquo; approved the older man
      patronizingly. &ldquo;I seldom touch it, otherwise than as a digestant.&rdquo; He
      poured himself a liberal allowance and set the glass on his desk. &ldquo;Whom do
      you represent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wymett smiled tolerantly. &ldquo;Of course. But whose capital?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A secret deal, eh? What reason have you to suppose that the paper is for
      sale?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was in the Senate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus unpleasantly recalled to his thorny situation, Mr. Wymett gulped down
      his whiskey and hastily poured another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A bare-faced forgery,&rdquo; he asserted with an effect of judicial severity;
      &ldquo;as will be proved at the proper time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us assume it to be, for the sake of courtesy. It got a quick
      endorsement,&rdquo; replied young Robson smoothly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wymett hastily set down the re-filled glass which he was voluptuously
      raising, and rather wished that he had n&rsquo;t taken that other one. Young
      Robson was not, perhaps, as young as his years.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Endorsement?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Locker and Mayne have skipped out. The forgery impressed them to that
      extent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yellow,&rdquo; commented the severe Mr. Wymett. His hand crept toward the
      stimulant which possesses the mystic power of changing timorous yellow
      into fighting red&mdash;up to a point&mdash;and was retracted again before
      attaining the goal. The caller&rsquo;s quick eye noted the movement. &ldquo;They own
      no part of The Guardian,&rdquo; added its proprietor, &ldquo;and their action has
      nothing to do with the matter of its sale.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; commented young Robson in a tone disturbingly indeterminate between
      confirmation and incredulity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been offered a hundred thousand for the paper,&rdquo; remarked Mr. Wymett
      casually.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Coal-oil Johnny must have been out this way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear young sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Wymett in a tone intended to be crushing; &ldquo;I
      am talking business. May I trouble you to do the same?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then The Guardian <i>is</i> for sale.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything in this world is for sale, at its price,&rdquo; returned the
      editor-owner, thereby unconsciously voicing his philosophy of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I assume that the price of The Guardian has not been increased by the
      events of to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Assume nothing of the sort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Young Mr. Robson leaned forward over the desk. &ldquo;Shall I talk plain talk?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be an indictment if you stay here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There will. For forgery. Against the author of that faked letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Against you. Nothing can stop it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did Embree promise you that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no question of promise. I don&rsquo;t even get your idea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed! Suppose you give me credit for a gleam of intelligence. Nothing
      more is required to see your game. Yours and Embree&rsquo;s. He wants to get his
      hands on a paper here. He fakes up this attack on me and The Guardian to
      bulldoze me into selling the paper. You are his tool. The pair of you
      think you can run me off my own property with an unloaded gun. Not A. M.
      Wymett!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very ingenious. But Senator Embree does n&rsquo;t happen to enter into this in
      any way, shape, or manner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then who is backing you? Is it Phipps and the brewery crowd? Or the
      banking trust? I don&rsquo;t suppose you&rsquo;ve saved the money out of your
      twenty-five a week from The Record.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s beside the question. The money is there. Seventy thousand dollars
      flat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Into Mr. Wymett&rsquo;s parched-looking eyes shot a swift gleam, only to be as
      swiftly veiled. He lifted and slowly drank the liquor before him. He shook
      his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not to be considered. Absurd.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is what I figure The Guardian to be worth; to have been worth up to
      two-fifteen this afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is worth just as much now as it was yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seventy thousand dollars,&rdquo; pursued young Robson as if the other had not
      spoken. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like your answer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed! And when would you like it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The visitor glanced at the clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, an hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, now! You are n&rsquo;t so innocent of business as to suppose that deals
      of this importance are put through on any such hair-trigger basis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not ordinarily. This is rather special, is n&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; insinuated the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frankly, I don&rsquo;t like your attitude, Mr. Robson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Consider your own.&rdquo; Jeremy&rsquo;s eyes hardened. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re fiddling and faddling
      within a step of the penitentiary. They&rsquo;ll get you if you try to hang to
      The Guardian. Public sentiment will demand it. Do you know that the
      Bellair papers are carrying the story?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damn &rsquo;em!&rdquo; said Mr. Wymett and visited the decanter again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, you see how far it&rsquo;s gone. Now, if it is known that you&rsquo;re out of the
      paper, they&rsquo;ll let up on you, won&rsquo;t they? That looks to me like the
      politics of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably,&rdquo; agreed Mr. Wymett.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what do you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me talk to my lawyer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Honorable Selden Dana was summoned, and came after a short delay, in
      the course of which Mr. Wymett had two more whiskies to his own good luck,
      for the price offered was better than he could have reasonably hoped. On
      Judge Dana&rsquo;s arrival he and Mr. Wymett retired for a conference. It was
      brief. Three words comprised the lawyer&rsquo;s advice: &ldquo;Sell and git!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve bought, Mr. Robson,&rdquo; he said, returning with his client for a
      drink, and departed thoughtfully, leaving the old and the new owner of The
      Guardian with duly signed preliminary agreements in their pockets. Jeremy
      was to take over control the first of the succeeding month.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you won&rsquo;t say where the money comes from?&rdquo; said the now relaxed and
      smiling Mr. Wymett.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For publication?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no. To satisfy personal curiosity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For that I would n&rsquo;t. Public curiosity, though; that&rsquo;s different. I
      suppose people will be interested to know who&rsquo;s back of the paper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll look to you to tell them. In to-morrow&rsquo;s Guardian. These are
      the facts, which you can verify by wire if you wish.&rdquo; And he related to
      the surprised Mr. Wymett the main circumstances of the Greer will. &ldquo;When
      that is published,&rdquo; he concluded, &ldquo;people will understand that it&rsquo;s my own
      money, that The Guardian is my own paper, and that there are no strings on
      it or me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wymett had another drink&mdash;&ldquo;just one more&rdquo;&mdash;to the success of
      The Guardian under its new management, and became expansive for once in
      his cautious life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve bought into a sporting proposition, young man.&rdquo; The retiring
      editor rested his lined and puckered face on his hand, and regarded his
      vis-à-vis thoughtfully. &ldquo;A sporting proposition. Oh, God; I&rsquo;m glad to be
      out of it&mdash;and sorry! It&rsquo;s a hell of a life, and I &lsquo;ve loved it. But
      in the end it gets you. Like a drug.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sat staring in a brief silence at the young, sanguine, keen face before
      him; a sad, humorous-eyed, ageing, slovenly, dishonest, tolerant
      philosopher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re young,&rdquo; he broke forth. &ldquo;Young enough, probably, to believe that
      you can run a newspaper and still be&mdash;and still keep your ideals. Oh,
      I had &rsquo;em, when I started in, just as you&rsquo;ve got &rsquo;em. Of
      course you&rsquo;ve got &rsquo;em! They go with youth. Perhaps they&rsquo;d stay with
      youth if youth would stay with us. But you grow old so damnably fast in
      this game. Look at me! Or perhaps you&rsquo;d better <i>not</i> look at me. You
      might see yourself as you&rsquo;ll be at my age.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not me,&rdquo; returned Jeremy Robson with unflattering conviction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not? Well, perhaps not. I &lsquo;m an old babbler. So you want Fenchester to
      know that it&rsquo;s your own money that&rsquo;s behind the paper?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; so they&rsquo;ll understand that it&rsquo;s a strictly one-man proposition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you think it&rsquo;s going to be. Oh, well; for a little while, maybe. Then&mdash;&rdquo;
       His voice was as that of one who regretfully deprives a child of a
      sweetmeat&mdash;&ldquo;you&rsquo;ll forego that happy and infantile dream. You&rsquo;re not
      going to run your newspaper just because you&rsquo;ve bought it. The politicians
      are going to run it for you. The banks are going to run it for you. The
      railroads and trolley lines and water-power companies and public-utility
      people are going to run it for you. And always the advertisers&mdash;the
      advertisers&mdash;the advertisers. You &rsquo;re going to be just a
      little, careful, polite Recording Secretary for them all. You &rsquo;ll
      print what they tell you to and you &rsquo;ll kill what they forbid you
      to print. Otherwise you can&rsquo;t live. Don&rsquo;t I know! I&rsquo;ve tried it&mdash;both
      ways.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He dreamed with somnolent eyes back over the happy, troubled, iniquitous,
      exciting years of The Guardian. &ldquo;And so you think you&rsquo;ll change all that!
      Not much to be left of the old Guardian, eh? Perhaps not even his
      figurehead, blowing his trumpet over the paper&rsquo;s title. I hope you&rsquo;ll
      leave that, though. It&rsquo;s been there a long time. Fifty-odd years. Almost
      as long as I&rsquo;ve lived. For old times&rsquo; sake I&rsquo;d like to see him stay, the
      old Guardian. We newspaper men are all sentimentalists and conservatives
      at heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not me,&rdquo; denied Jeremy. &ldquo;Not the conservative part, anyway. But I &lsquo;ll
      leave The Guardian his trumpet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That trumpet! I was going to rock the walls of Jericho with it! They
      still stand; you may have noticed that. There&rsquo;s a lot of solidity about
      our modern Jericho. As for us poor Joshuas of the newspapers, our trumpet
      is n&rsquo;t a trumpet any more. It&rsquo;s the horn of a talking-machine. We&rsquo;re just
      damned phonographs playing the records that bigger men thrust into our
      mechanical insides. Am I boring you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; said Jeremy Robson. &ldquo;I took a course in journalism at college.
      There was nothing in it like this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There would n&rsquo;t be. <i>I&rsquo;d</i> like to lecture to &rsquo;em on the Voice
      of the Press. The Voice from the Horn! Nickel-in-the-slot and you get your
      tune. The politician drops his coin in and gets his favorite selection, in
      consideration of a job on a board. The city authorities drop their coin in&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      the official printing&mdash;and you sing their little song. The railroads
      drop in a few favors, passes and the like, and the horn grinds out their
      pet record. And always the advertiser, big, small, and medium; he owns
      your paper, news and editorials, and you&rsquo;ll do as he says or&mdash;where
      do you get off!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then there&rsquo;s the silencers,&rdquo; continued the remorseless lecturer.
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget the silencers. The Dutch and the Swedes and the Norwegians
      and the Irish, all with tender toes. The Jews and the Methodists and the
      Catholics and the Lutherans, all touchy as wasps. You can&rsquo;t afford to play
      any tune they don&rsquo;t like. And always there&rsquo;s Deutschtum. Know what
      &lsquo;Deutschtum&rsquo; is? No, you would n&rsquo;t. Well, it means that German-Americans
      are organized for German purposes all through the Middle West, and nowhere
      more strongly than in this State. When Germany declares war on Europe,
      which will be within ten years&mdash;yes, I&rsquo;ve been grinned at before by
      people who considered this just a crazy hobby of mine&mdash;all our Bunds
      and Vereins and Gesellschafts are going to see to it that the United
      States either stays out or goes in on the &lsquo;right&rsquo; side. Why, they&rsquo;re
      making a Little Germany of us right here in this State and city by slow,
      methodical, Teuton education, managed by our school boards which are run
      by Germans, trained to it in the public schools&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a thing I&rsquo;d like to tackle,&rdquo; said Robson thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hands off, young David! The Dutch Goliath is too big for your sling. No,
      sir! Stand in with them. You&rsquo;ll find them reasonable and easy enough to
      deal with so long as you don&rsquo;t interfere with their programme. Play the
      German tune and they&rsquo;ll play yours. Study &rsquo;em, flatter &rsquo;em a
      little, and watch &rsquo;em. Theirs is the winning game.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To trail along with the successful element,&rdquo; continued the cynical
      oracle: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the great secret. It&rsquo;s the only way for a newspaper. There
      lies your profit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In other words, selling out to the highest bidder,&rdquo; translated his
      disenchanted listener.
    </p>
    <p>
      The volunteer professor of journalism took one more drink and gazed with
      surprise and reproach at the empty bottle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t say you&rsquo;ll sell out, all at once. It&rsquo;s a gradual process.
      Step by step, finding a nice soft excuse to plant your foot on each time,
      until you hit the bottom. Don&rsquo;t I know! What you won&rsquo;t do for fear, you&rsquo;ll
      do for friendship&mdash;and then for favor&mdash;and then for preferment.&rdquo;
       His voice dropped, and his eyes sought the empty liquor glass. &ldquo;And then&mdash;for
      cash.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The younger man stirred, uneasy under that intimate and betraying
      confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s a rotten game, and Lord! how I hate to be quitting it!&rdquo; pursued
      the philosopher. &ldquo;How I&rsquo;d love to be you, just getting really into it!
      Perhaps I&rsquo;d do different. Make a better job of it. Keep to my ideals.
      Perhaps not. Too heavy odds.&rdquo; His eyes lifted again with a bleary, dreamy
      wistfulness. &ldquo;So you&rsquo;re going to run an honest newspaper in Fenchester,
      are you, son?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The visitor rose. &ldquo;You bet I am!&rdquo; he said jubilantly. [<i>Often in the
      vivid years to follow, the young owner of The Guardian had cause to
      reflect that the shrewdest professional advice which he had ever
      disregarded came from one who had just &ldquo;stuck&rdquo; him with an all-but-ruinous
      bargain.</i>]
    </p>
    <p>
      Late as was the interview, he could n&rsquo;t go to bed without telling Andrew
      Galpin. Much depended on that astute youth. Jeremy routed him out of bed,
      at his boarding-house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come out and get a rarebit and a stein of beer, Andy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay-a-a-ah!&rdquo; yawned Galpin. &ldquo;Watsamatter with you? What time is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quarter to one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re crazy, young fellow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m worse than that. I&rsquo;ve just bought The Guardian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>What!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;d you get the money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Left to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much did you pay?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seventy thousand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seventy! You fat-wit!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with that?&rdquo; asked Jeremy, crestfallen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty thousand nice, fat, round, cool dollars is what&rsquo;s the matter with
      it. Why did n&rsquo;t you tell me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did n&rsquo;t have the time. I caught Wymett when he was scared.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He caught you when you were easy,&rdquo; retorted Galpin in disgust. &ldquo;How did
      you happen to get stuck for seventy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy looked sulky. &ldquo;I figured it out on a basis of advertising and
      circulation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, hell! You poor innocent!&rdquo; These unpalatable observations he left his
      caller to digest while he retired to wash his face. In the act of lacing
      up his left boot he remarked: &ldquo;You could have got it for fifty. Fifty-five
      at the outside.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It ought to make eight thousand a year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On paper,&rdquo; was Galpin&rsquo;s laconic comment. He looked up from his right
      boot. &ldquo;Its advertising rate card is all bunk. Rotten with rebates.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Jeremy blankly. &ldquo;Anyway, it can be made to make money,&rdquo; he
      added, recovering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe. How much reserve have you got?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, about fifteen thousand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll eat that in the first year,&rdquo; observed Galpin, slipping into his
      suspenders.
    </p>
    <p>
      A dismayed silence fell between the friends. &ldquo;Well, come on,&rdquo; said Jeremy
      finally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ll spoil your appetite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have n&rsquo;t improved it,&rdquo; admitted Jeremy. &ldquo;So you think I&rsquo;ve made a
      fool of myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you&rsquo;ve bought a dog, and an old dog.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It can be taught new tricks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A yellow dog.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It hasn&rsquo;t always been yellow. It needn&rsquo;t keep on being.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll be comfortable in its hide.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Andy, I&rsquo;d counted on you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Galpin stopped buttoning his waistcoat and looked up. &ldquo;For what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To help me make a real newspaper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As how?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;General manager.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that why you&rsquo;re asking me out to beer up, young fellow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Galpin removed his waistcoat and hung it neatly on a chair back. He then
      proceeded to unlace his right boot. &ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; demanded Jeremy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Going back to bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not interested?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Worse than that. I&rsquo;m excited.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Want time to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Want nothin&rsquo;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No beer for me. No midnight racketings. I go on the water wagon right
      here. Also the sleep wagon.&rdquo; He folded his trousers lengthwise upon his
      trunk, and reached for his pajamas. &ldquo;I advise you the same,&rdquo; he added.
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got a job, you and I, training a yellow dog to jump in and fight
      for its life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re on for the job, then, Andy?&rdquo; cried Jeremy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boss,&rdquo; said Andrew Galpin, rolling over into his dishevelled bed, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve
      hired a hand.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER I
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>OTIVES not fully
      formulated had impelled Jeremy Robson to the purchase of The Fenchester
      Guardian. Now that he was face to face with the multiform problem of what
      he was to do with his new responsibility, he sought to determine why he
      had possessed himself of it, hoping to discover in that Why a clue to his
      future course.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several figures at once stepped to the front of his mind and imperiously
      claimed credit for inspiring his action. There was Montrose Clark who had
      capped his impersonal insolences by the shibboleth, &ldquo;rippawtah.&rdquo; Nobody
      was ever going to give Jeremy Robson curt orders as a &ldquo;rippawtah&rdquo; again.
      (But he had the saving sense to grin at himself for the triviality of it!)
      There was Andrew Galpin, who had said of the pleasant pursuit of editorial
      writing that the practitioner of it &ldquo;was licked&mdash;a beaten man,&rdquo; thus
      taking all the gloss from that phase. There was Milliken, crude, coarse,
      malicious, with his inept but biting epithets, and his blatant jibes at
      the necessities of hired-man (or worse-than-hired-woman) journalism. There
      was Eli Wade, whom he had written down to order&mdash;though herein Jeremy
      was still dallying with self-delusions, since it was the lure of his own
      facile pen that had betrayed him there&mdash;and to whom he owed a
      reparation which he could perhaps now make. There was his old purpose of
      some day owning a paper; quite a different paper, however, from the feeble
      and dubious Guardian. More potent was the influence, never wholly abated,
      of that talk with Senator Martin Embree wherein the shrewd judge of men
      and agencies had suggested the power to be exerted for good by a
      fair-minded, independent daily. But the real motivating power was Marcia
      Ames. Withdrawing herself from him, she had left him a legacy of influence
      which was, at the same time, a debt. He owed it to himself to prove to her
      that he could be as honorable as she had deemed him dishonorable; as
      trustworthy as she had deemed him unfit to be trusted; and he must do this
      through this same medium of print whereby he had offended. Something
      dogged in him prescribed that he should work out his salvation there on
      the spot. She might never return to see it. She might never even know of
      it. But it would be her work. By so much, at least, Jeremy would hold her.
      And in doing what she would have him do, he would fill that bleak and arid
      void, which, lacking hope, can be appeased only by activity.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was no easy task which Jeremy Robson had set himself, that of making
      his new property a vehicle for ideals. He was content that it should not
      be easy. He craved hard, exacting, stimulant work. The Guardian offered it
      in more generous measure than a better paper could have done. Jeremy
      purposed to save The Guardian&rsquo;s soul. Perhaps he had some underlying
      notion that he might save his own, in the process.
    </p>
    <p>
      That bad name which, given to a dog, is proverbially alleged to bring down
      upon him a peculiarly un-canine fate at the hangman&rsquo;s hands, had long
      attached to The Fenchester Guardian. But the paper&rsquo;s ill-repute was no
      man&rsquo;s gift. It had been justly earned. Once the stiffly high-minded
      personal organ of a stilted and honorable old-school statesman, it had
      fallen, under A. M. Wymett, to become a mongrel of journalism, a forlorn
      and servile whiner, fawning for petty favors, kicked about by the
      financial and political interests of the State, and not infrequently
      ornamented with a tin can of scandal to its tail in the form of dirty work
      performed for some temporary subsidizer in the background. Thanks to
      shrewd legal advice and his own editorial adroitness, its guiding spirit
      had contrived to escape the law, and, up to the episode of the
      disastrously imprudent &ldquo;cheese-check&rdquo; letter, open and public contumely.
      Further, he had, by dint of sheer ability of a low ethical order but high
      technical grade, maintained a fair circulation for his paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Its only competitor in the bustling, growing State capital, with its
      seventy thousand inhabitants, was The Record. There was no morning
      newspaper. Several plans to start one had come to naught, because of the
      secret opposition of the local leaders of politics and industry, who were
      well content with the two mild and amenable specimens of journalism
      already in the field. The Record represented stolid, stodgy, profitable,
      and unprogressive respectability in a community now astir with new and
      uneasy fermentations. The Guardian had always represented what it was
      bidden to represent. What attitude it might adopt under the new control,
      was a question not assumed to be troublesome by those whom a change might
      conceivably trouble in no small degree. It was comfortably taken for
      granted that The Guardian would &ldquo;be good&rdquo; when the time and test came. For
      the corruptible to put on incorruptibility, in the newspaper world, is a
      phenomenon so rare as to be practically negligible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon or late these questions would come to an issue between the new owner
      of The Guardian and those who had quietly controlled it for their own
      ends. So much Jeremy Robson apprehended. What he had not foreseen was a
      more immediate and imperative consideration. He had vaguely believed that
      he was taking possession of a semipublic agency of enlightenment. He found
      that he had bought a Struggle for Existence. Quite a number of shrewd and
      active citizens whose existence had not hitherto impressed him as
      important, loomed as figures and probably antagonists in the struggle.
      Jeremy found himself in the way of learning some new and important things
      about the newspaper business, with his local advertisers in the pedagogic
      chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Newspapers do not live by the bread of circulation alone, but chiefly by
      the strong and sustaining meat of advertising patronage. This important
      fact had duly entered into Jeremy Robson&rsquo;s calculations. On paper he had
      figured a clear profit for The Guardian, before purchasing. After taking
      over the property he found his estimates borne out by the formal accounts.
      But he also found, to his discomfiture, that The Guardian&rsquo;s books had been
      kept by a sunny optimist with a taste for fiction. This gentleman had
      plugged up the discrepancies in the papers finances with ingenious
      figures, as a boat-jerry might doctor a leaky seam with putty and paint&mdash;for
      sale only.
    </p>
    <p>
      The book figures showed but one scale of advertising rates, with the
      normal discounts to heavy users of space. While the new toy was still
      agleam in the eyes of its proud possessor with all the glamour of novelty,
      he began to discover that instead of a standard price to advertisers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Guardian had more scales than even so fishy a proposition was entitled
      to; that, in fact, A. M. Wymett had peddled about his precious advertising
      space like a man with stolen diamonds to sell, and covered the shady
      transactions by a system of ingenious and destructive rebates. Thus, the
      columns which young Mr. Robson had confidingly calculated at four to nine
      cents per line, were actually fetching from five cents downward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the first thing to be set right,&rdquo; announced Jeremy after a
      profoundly unsatisfactory study of his property&rsquo;s earning capacity as
      contrasted with its paper profits. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have a one-price-to-all system
      hereafter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay-ah,&rdquo; drawled Andrew Galpin, to whom the decision was communicated.
      &ldquo;Your advertisers &rsquo;ll just love that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They ought to be satisfied. It&rsquo;s the only square way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, they&rsquo;ll be satisfied if you put the scale low enough. But if you put
      the scale low enough you&rsquo;ll go broke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wymett did n&rsquo;t go broke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Guardian had other sources of revenue under Wymett.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such as the Cheese Bill fund?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Occasionally. Also the steady, reliable revenue from the advertising
      matter that does n&rsquo;t bear the a-d-v sign.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean store &lsquo;readers&rsquo; and that sort of thing? I&rsquo;m going to cut those
      out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are, you? They&rsquo;re semi-legitimate. Compared with some of the stuff we&rsquo;ve
      carried they&rsquo;re so high-principled they&rsquo;re almost holy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what, for instance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Paid editorials. Paid political articles. Paid puffs and roasts. Brewery
      checks. Railroad checks. P.-U. checks. Paving and other contractors&rsquo;
      checks. You can read it all in the back files, if you&rsquo;re newspaper man
      enough to read between the lines.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never saw any of that on The Record.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t there. The Record don&rsquo;t do it that way; a little more decent.
      The Record&rsquo;s a kept-lady. We&rsquo;re on the street&mdash;or were.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Were&rsquo; is right.&rdquo; Jeremy ran his hands through his hair and regarded his
      companion anxiously. &ldquo;Andy?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay-ah?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were you&mdash;Did you&mdash;Never mind. It does n&rsquo;t matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay-ah; it matters all right. You were going to ask me whether I had to
      write any of that bought-and-paid-for stuff. And you were afraid to. Is
      that right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy turned red.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; confirmed the other. &ldquo;Well, I never did. I would n&rsquo;t. I gave
      &rsquo;em notice that I was fired the noon of the morning I got one of
      those jobs. They were decent about it. But I had to do the next worse
      thing. I had to let myself be called off a story so that some other guy
      could write it, and write it crooked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have we had any&mdash;any offers since we took hold of the paper?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give &rsquo;em time, Boss. It&rsquo;s only a month, and in the slack period at
      that. But I&rsquo;ll tell you one thing. If you&rsquo;re going to change the entire
      advertising policy, you&rsquo;ll have to change your advertising manager, for
      Perley don&rsquo;t know anything different from the news-selling and rebate
      game.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perley&rsquo;s fired.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So far, so good. Who &rsquo;ve you got to take his place?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody, yet. Could you manage it, Andy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Temporarily, I might. But I&rsquo;m going to have my hands too full re-making
      the old sheet on the news side to give much time to advertising, in the
      next year or so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Temporarily will do. I&rsquo;m going to get the principal merchants together
      and talk it out with them. And I want to show &rsquo;em a change in the
      advertising managership that&rsquo;ll convince &rsquo;em the change of policy
      is real.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay-ah,&rdquo; assented Galpin. &ldquo;It sounds like the rumble of distant thunder to
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all. All I want is a decent, living rate for the paper. Every
      merchant expects a living profit on his merchandise. Why should n&rsquo;t a
      newspaper get the same?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Logical. Perfectly logical. But can you get &rsquo;em to see it that
      way?&rdquo; Andrew Galpin paused and then delivered himself of a characteristic
      bit of shrewdness. &ldquo;The average storekeeper regards advertising outlay as
      a sort of accepted blackmail which he pays under protest; he don&rsquo;t know
      exactly why, and he don&rsquo;t know exactly for what. If you made him reason it
      out, he&rsquo;d probably say that he don&rsquo;t believe it pays, but everybody does
      it. Of course, he don&rsquo;t know whether it pays or not. Nobody does, really.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why does he do it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because his competitors do. He&rsquo;s afraid not to. He has some dim sort of
      fear that the papers will soak him if he don&rsquo;t. That&rsquo;s where the blackmail
      comes in, if he had sense enough to figure it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There won&rsquo;t be any blackmail with us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the merchants won&rsquo;t know it. They&rsquo;ll advertise, and because they
      advertise they&rsquo;ll think they&rsquo;re entitled to a say in the paper. They&rsquo;ll
      try to run it for you, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will they?&rdquo; muttered Jeremy in a tone which suggested that there might be
      difficulties attending the fulfillment of the ambition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay-ah. In good faith, too. There&rsquo;s something in their theory&mdash;I
      guess&mdash;from their point of view.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll give them a chance to explain it,&rdquo; said the new owner. &ldquo;My
      plan is to round &rsquo;em up at a lunch, and then have it out with &rsquo;em.
      What do you think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fine! Feed &rsquo;em. Then kick &rsquo;em in the stomach.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir! pat &rsquo;em on the back and talk reason to them. That&rsquo;s where
      <i>you</i> come in. They know you&rsquo;re a real newspaper man. They&rsquo;ve got to
      find it out yet, about me.&rdquo; Out of thirty of the principal local
      advertisers in The Guardian, twenty-one accepted Jeremy Robson&rsquo;s
      invitation to lunch with him at the Fenchester Club, with a &ldquo;business
      conference&rdquo; to follow. Their attitude toward the gustatory part of the
      proceedings was that of wary fish toward food which might conceal a hook.
      Very nice luncheon, but&mdash;what was behind it? They had never had
      confidence in The Guardian under A. M. Wymett. Why should they have more
      in an unknown quantity like young Robson?
    </p>
    <p>
      Sensing plainly this feeling, Jeremy perceived that here was the time and
      place for finesse. Unfortunately he lacked that particular quality. What
      was the next best thing to having it at call, he appreciated his want of
      it, and instead of blundering strategically around the point he went
      straight to it in the briefest of speeches.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen: I&rsquo;ve brought you here to state the new policy of The Guardian.
      The advertising rate will be that of the rate card. The same system of
      discounts to all. No rebates. I&rsquo;d be glad to hear your views.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sat down. A hum of surprise went about the table. Some one started
      applause: the effort was abortive. It was no occasion for empty
      courtesies. This was business!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Talks straight,&rdquo; remarked Betts, of Kelter &amp; Betts, dry goods, in a
      loud whisper, to his neighbor Arthur Turnbull, of the Emporium.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bluff,&rdquo; opined Turnbull.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get up and call it,&rdquo; suggested A. Friedland, proprietor of the Big Shop
      who had overheard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let Ellison do the talking,&rdquo; returned Turnbull. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s president of our
      association.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Obedient to several suggestions, Matthew Ellison, head of Ellison
      Brothers&rsquo; department store and president of the Retailers&rsquo; Association,
      reared his ample form, and smiled his conscientious smile, from above a
      graying chin whisker, upon the assembled feasters. In a long and rambling
      talk which Andrew Galpin would have fairly slaughtered with an editorial
      blue pencil, Mr. Ellison referred to Jeremy something more than two dozen
      times as &ldquo;our esteemed young friend&rdquo; and at least a dozen as &ldquo;my dear
      young friend&rdquo;; both of which were equally accurate and sincere. The gist
      of his speech, so far as any one present could grasp it, seemed to
      indicate a guarded agnosticism concerning the announced policy of the
      paper. Upon the heels of the windy compliment with which he closed, Adolph
      Ahrens, junior partner and advertising manager of the Great Northwestern
      Stores, popped up. Mr. Ahrens was a young, blackish, combative-jawed man
      with twitchy eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This don&rsquo;t go,&rdquo; he said belligerently. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a letter in my files,
      stipulating a rebate, that&rsquo;s as good as a contract.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Signed by?&rdquo; queried Jeremy suggestively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Signed by The Guardian, per A. M. Wymett.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So have I,&rdquo; declared Turnbull, and was echoed by Lehn, of Stormont &amp;
      Lehn, Betts, and half a dozen more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to have been a habit,&rdquo; remarked Jeremy. &ldquo;But, gentlemen, A. M.
      Wymett is no longer The Guardian. His secret rebates do not bind us
      indefinitely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The courts &rsquo;ll have a word to say on that,&rdquo; declared the combative
      Ahrens.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Easy, gentlemen! Let&rsquo;s be friendly,&rdquo; purred Matthew Ellison.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We need n&rsquo;t go to the courts,&rdquo; put in Andrew Galpin. &ldquo;In the cases where
      rebates were offered, the rate will be raised to a point where it covers
      the rebates.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where do <i>you</i> come in?&rdquo; demanded Ahrens.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As acting advertising manager of The Guardian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What becomes of your &lsquo;one-rate-for-all&rsquo; claim?&rdquo; Turnbull turned upon
      Jeremy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Discarded,&rdquo; said the owner, promptly accepting Galpin&rsquo;s strategy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why ain&rsquo;d I neffer gud any discound?&rdquo; inquired Bernard Stockmuller, the
      leading jeweler of the town, in a powerful and plaintive voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because you never had the sense to stick out for it, Barney,&rdquo; retorted
      Betts. &ldquo;You were easy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There you have the unfairness of the system,&rdquo; Jeremy pointed out. &ldquo;Mr.
      Stockmuller is as frequent a user of space as some of you who have taken
      rebates. Gentlemen, it does n&rsquo;t go any more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, this is a hell of a note!&rdquo; murmured a discontented voice which
      seemed to emanate from the depths of the abdominal curve of the senior
      partner of Arndt &amp; Niebuhr, furniture dealers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did any of these private letters from Mr. Wymett mention reading notices
      as an extra inducement?&rdquo; asked the host of the occasion. .
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was no need,&rdquo; stated Ellison. &ldquo;&lsquo;Readers&rsquo; are a recognized courtesy
      to advertisers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They take up space,&rdquo; Jeremy pointed out. &ldquo;They cost money, for ink,
      paper, and setting up. From the newspaper&rsquo;s viewpoint, they&rsquo;re a dead
      loss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We pay for &rsquo;em in our advertising bills,&rdquo; said Friedland, of the
      Big Shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you regard them as advertising?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they don&rsquo;t appear as advertising. They are in regular news type, made
      up to look like news items, and they carry no a-d-v mark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Matthew Ellison took it upon his kindly self to enlighten this innocent
      young adventurer in untried fields. &ldquo;If they appeared as advertising, the
      public would be less likely to read them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then they&rsquo;re a fraud on the public.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fraud? Oh, really, Mr. Robson,&rdquo; deprecated the merchant. &ldquo;A&mdash;a
      harmless&mdash;er&mdash;subterfuge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Guardian cuts them out,&rdquo; announced The Guardian&rsquo;s revolutionary
      proprietor. &ldquo;No more &lsquo;readers&rsquo; except with the a-d-v sign, and paid for at
      full rates.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you trying to do&mdash;insult us?&rdquo; growled the saturnine Mr.
      Ahrens.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would have to be mighty thin-skinned to find an insult in that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, drive us out of the paper, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would be pretty foolish of me, would n&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would be? It <i>is</i>. First you violate an agreement&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To which I was not a party.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;and then you try to raise rates on us; and now you cut out the
      best advertising the department store gets.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for raising rates, I have n&rsquo;t suggested it except as an offset to
      rebates.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Comes to the same thing,&rdquo; said several voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said Jeremy with an accession of positiveness, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re
      getting the best advertising rate in the State of Centralia to-day. With
      practically ten thousand circulation&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bunk!&rdquo; interjected Turnbull.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upwards of nine thousand, seven hundred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A good third of it pads and graft copies,&rdquo; put in Betts.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the first time Jeremy was at a disadvantage. He glanced quickly at
      Galpin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing of the sort,&rdquo; declared that gentleman readily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much is your list padded?&rdquo; challenged Vogt the florist, in his
      slightly thickened accent. &ldquo;Come on, now! On the level.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell them, Mr. Galpin,&rdquo; directed Jeremy. &ldquo;Our cards are on the table.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. But it&rsquo;s padded all right,&rdquo; confessed the general manager.
      &ldquo;Not a third. Not a quarter. But&mdash;well, enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For the second time that day Jeremy Robson took a snap resolution.
      &ldquo;Appoint a committee to go over the books, Mr. Ellison,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Make
      your estimate of <i>bona fide</i> circulation, and I&rsquo;ll adjust my rate to
      make it as low per thousand as any daily in the State of equal size. Is
      that fair?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I guess that&rsquo;s fair enough,&rdquo; answered the Retailers&rsquo; Association
      president, hesitantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That don&rsquo;t satisfy me,&rdquo; asserted Ahrens.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will, Mr. Ahrens?&rdquo; asked Jeremy politely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Readers,&rsquo; like the Great Northwestern&rsquo;s always had.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The next time I come to your store to buy a necktie, will you throw in a
      box of collars?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t the same thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me; it&rsquo;s precisely the same, considered as a deal. You don&rsquo;t give
      people more than they pay for. Why should you expect to get it? All I ask
      for The Guardian is a living profit on the plant and product.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wymett made a living out of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What Mr. Wymett did is not under discussion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say this for it, though,&rdquo; interjected Galpin. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not going to
      make the kind of living in the kind of way that Mr. Wymett made his. Get
      that, you men?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The stir that this roused was sufficient evidence of general knowledge
      concerning The Guardian&rsquo;s former management.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, you&rsquo;re talking!&rdquo; said Betts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dot&rsquo;s goot. I like dot,&rdquo; added Stockmuller.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the first evidence of approval that the new policy had elicited.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much having been said,&rdquo; proceeded Jeremy: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you gentlemen
      this. The Guardian is going to be run straight. If you ever see any
      evidence that it is n&rsquo;t, I want to know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine, Mr. Robson,&rdquo; said Ellison warmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the kind of thing we want to hear. We&rsquo;re all for that and will
      wish you the success you deserve. And now there&rsquo;s one more matter I think
      ought to be taken up here. We considered it at the last meeting of the
      association, and this is as good a time and place as any to thrash it out.
      Speaking for myself and associates, Mr. Robson, we&rsquo;d like to know what
      consideration an advertiser in The Guardian may expect at its hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Consideration?&rdquo; Jeremy said, puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the matter of news.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Another side-glance at Galpin apprised Jeremy that this was at least as
      important as anything that had gone before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that I shall have to ask you to explain,&rdquo; said Jeremy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will give you an example: the case which we had up for discussion at
      our last meeting. It concerns one of our members, Mr. Barclay, of Barclay
      &amp; Bull, shoe dealers. Barclay &amp; Bull are liberal advertisers in
      The Guardian, Mr. Robson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Last Tuesday The Guardian published a report of the Blair Street
      Methodist Church meeting, which put Mr. Barclay in a quite unfortunate
      light.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was n&rsquo;t our report accurate?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not saying whether it was accurate or inaccurate,&rdquo; returned Ellison
      conservatively. &ldquo;The point is that it was unfortunate. It subjected Mr.
      Barclay to criticism. How could Mr. Barclay foresee that The Guardian,
      which his firm had always patronized, would catch up a hasty and somewhat
      violent expression used in the heat of debate, and publish it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The meeting was a public meeting. Why should n&rsquo;t we report it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear young friend, I am endeavoring to tell you. Do you not owe
      something to Mr. Barclay, as an advertiser?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does Mr. Barclay owe anything to me because I buy my shoes at his store?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ellison&rsquo;s face shone with the prognostication of argumentative
      triumph. &ldquo;Pree-cisely the point! He does. He owes you courtesy as a
      patron. You owe him courtesy as a patron. That article should, if I may
      express an opinion, have omitted his name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see. Because Mr. Barclay is an advertiser in The Guardian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so,&rdquo; beamed Ellison.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m selling Mr. Barclay advertising, not news.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The courtesy due to an&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me. It&rsquo;s no question of courtesy. The Guardian sells its news to
      its readers. It sells its advertising to its advertisers. You&rsquo;ve got two
      different things badly mixed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ellison looked crestfallen, but rallied to another and more direct
      argument. &ldquo;Barclay &amp; Bull intend withdrawing their advertising from
      The Guardian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s their affair,&rdquo; said Jeremy shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, surely, my dear young friend, it is equally the affair of your
      paper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s a question of Barclay &amp; Bull withdrawing their advertising or
      The Guardian withdrawing its news policy, we&rsquo;ll have to hump along without
      the advertising.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here!&rdquo; The twitchy eyes of Adolph Ahrens focused themselves angrily
      on the host. &ldquo;S&rsquo;pose I go motoring up to Bellair. S&rsquo;pose I get pinched by
      a joy constable. S&rsquo;pose I send around word I want it kept out of the
      paper. Don&rsquo;t I get a show?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a show,&rdquo; declared Jeremy good-humoredly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re too prominent a
      character, Mr. Ahrens, not to make good reading.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From the ventriloqual depths of Mr. Arndt there again emanated that
      gentleman&rsquo;s conviction concerning the infernal quality of the note of Mr.
      Robson&rsquo;s conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Engel the grocer saw The Guardian&rsquo;s finish, and made no secret of his
      prophetic vision.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aaron Levy, pursuing his trade under the ambitious title of &ldquo;The Fashion,&rdquo;
       expressed the opinion that no man&rsquo;s business was safe in a town where such
      practices were permitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Und you maig funny-nesses aboud the Chermans, too,&rdquo; accused Bernard
      Stockmuller, the jeweler, unexpectedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vogt came to his support. &ldquo;That reporter ought to be fired,&rdquo; he
      proclaimed. &ldquo;The one that wrote the police court article about the brewery
      driver.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Why, there was no malice in that,&rdquo; defended Jeremy. &ldquo;It was all
      good-natured fun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wass fun at the Chermans,&rdquo; declared Stockmuller. &ldquo;Cherman accents.
      Cherman ignorances. What you wan ta pigk on the Chermans for, always?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t, Mr. Stockmuller. That&rsquo;s absurd. We&rsquo;d print an Irish dialect
      story just as quickly. In fact we do, frequently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should understand,&rdquo; said Blasius the hatter, heavily, &ldquo;that we
      Germans are as good citizens as anybody else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Granted, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And priddy heavy advertisers in The Guardian.&rdquo; This was Vogt&rsquo;s
      contribution.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy began to lose his temper. &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said he sharply, &ldquo;if you
      take over the job of running The Guardian as you seem to wish to do, where
      do I come in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Easy! Friendly!&rdquo; pacified Ellison. &ldquo;No use in getting excited.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thinks he can run the town,&rdquo; growled Ahrens.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is much in Mr. Robson&rsquo;s point of view,&rdquo; continued the pourer of
      oil. &ldquo;And I am sure that he will concede the force of much that has been
      said upon the other side. In any case I am sure we have all come to a
      better understanding, and that we thank Mr. Robson most appreciatively for
      his bounteous hospitality. And, now, gentlemen, I propose that we&mdash;er&mdash;adjourn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ahrens and two of the others forgot to bid Jeremy good-bye. When all had
      left, the giver of the feast turned to his lieutenant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, they know where we stand. How many advertisers will it lose us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that it&rsquo;ll lose us any, right away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ahrens, surely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t believe it. He&rsquo;ll be afraid to drop out. He don&rsquo;t understand your
      go-to-hell attitude.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was I as bad as that, Andy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m taking his point of view. He don&rsquo;t understand it, and probably he
      don&rsquo;t believe it. Thinks it&rsquo;s bluff. But he&rsquo;s scared and he&rsquo;s cautious. So
      he&rsquo;ll stay in&mdash;for a while, anyway. What we&rsquo;ve got to do in the long
      run, is to keep &rsquo;em all scared.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Going in for blackmail, Andy?&rdquo; smiled his boss.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep &rsquo;em scared, by making the paper so strong that they dassent
      do without it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That means more circulation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It means more circulation, a lot of it, and pretty darn quick. That&rsquo;s my
      job.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arrived at the office, Jeremy got his final glimpse of the day into the
      ramifications of advertising. In his editorial sanctum waited a mild,
      self-possessed, and profoundly laconic Chinaman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take ad?&rdquo; inquired he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your ad? What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Laundry.&rdquo; He proffered a neat and competently prepared two-inch single
      column &ldquo;card,&rdquo; announcing that Wong Kee stood ready to perform high-class
      laundering for the discerning public at reasonable prices.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. Take it to the Advertising window.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Turn down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chinese laundry. Turn down,&rdquo; asseverated Wong Kee evenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When did you try?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nineteen-eight. Nineteen-nine. Nineteen-ten. Nineteen-eleven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every year? Nineteen-twelve wins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy marked &ldquo;Must J. R.&rdquo; on the copy and sent the satisfied Celestial
      downstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the following morning, eight local professional apostles of
      cleanliness, comprising the Laundry Association of Fenchester, indignantly
      notified The Guardian of the withdrawal of their patronage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even the laundrymen want to edit the paper for us,&rdquo; the disgusted Jeremy
      observed to Galpin. &ldquo;Well, they can stay out till hell breaks loose under
      the State of Centralia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As a matter of fact, that is exactly what they did.

      CHAPTER II
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">N</span>O advertising
      patronage was lost to The Guardian as the result of the
      luncheon-conference. But Jeremy Robson&rsquo;s offer to let a committee
      investigate his circulation was costly. More than fifteen per cent of The
      Guardian&rsquo;s list proved either &ldquo;phony&rdquo; or dubious. Jeremy reconstituted his
      rate card in accordance with the actual figures, and cut recklessly into
      his free list. Appeased by this practical and to them profitable
      concession, the Retailers&rsquo; Association abandoned the issue of rebates. For
      the time, at least, they accepted the new proprietor&rsquo;s distasteful
      decision as to &ldquo;readers.&rdquo; The matter of &ldquo;courtesies&rdquo; extended to
      advertisers was left in abeyance. That was sure to come up in the
      inevitable course of events. The general status was that of a truce, with
      one side wary and the other disgruntled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unsatisfactory though this might be to the mercantile element, it was more
      so to the newspaper. For The Guardian simply could not make a living at
      the reduced rates. There was but one thing to be done: increase
      circulation, thereby giving the paper augmented advertising value, and
      raise the advertising rates proportionately. It had been agreed between
      the Retailers&rsquo; Association committee and Jeremy that in view of his
      reduction of tariff, there would be no opposition to an increase when the
      circulation should warrant it. Ellison and the other committeemen did not
      believe that The Guardian could add to its circulation materially. Jeremy
      and his general manager did. They did n&rsquo;t know just how. They only knew
      that it had to, or pass ignominiously out of existence!
    </p>
    <p>
      So they took the customary business-man&rsquo;s gamble. In the hope of making
      money they spent money. The paper began to swell out and look lively and
      prosperous. But Jeremy&rsquo;s bank account evidenced the ravages of a galloping
      consumption. And though the public talked about The Guardian and
      speculated interestedly upon its future, it did not fall over itself to
      subscribe. It waited to see and be convinced. The public has that habit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile two able gentlemen with no ostensible interest in journalism
      were quietly watching and estimating the course of The Guardian. President
      Montrose Clark, of the Fenchester Public Utilities Corporation, and his
      legal aide-de-camp Judge Selden Dana, a pair far more potent in
      Fenchester&rsquo;s political affairs than Fenchester&rsquo;s undisceming citizenry
      ever dreamed, were concerned with the newspapers as affecting their own
      plans, and were specially concerned with Jeremy Robson&rsquo;s newspaper because
      they possessed no reliable data on young Mr. Robson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know him?&rdquo; asked Judge Dana.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Montrose Clark, whose interview with the &ldquo;rippawtah&rdquo; of The
      Record had failed to leave any memory of the young man&rsquo;s name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think of The Guardian since he got it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s silly,&rdquo; pronounced Mr. Clark loftily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silly? Would you call it silly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I <i>have</i> called it silly. It is beginning to show leanings toward a
      half-baked radicalism.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Robson is very young.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even socialistic tendencies,&rdquo; pursued the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Socialism is anything that holds up our programme,&rdquo; grinned the lawyer,
      who occasionally permitted himself the private luxury of frankness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The public utilitarian frowned. &ldquo;Have you been reading the articles on
      tax-dodgers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the purpose of them, if not to stir up socialistic unrest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sensation, I should say. The series has been popular. When Mr. Average
      Citizen reads in his paper that he is being taxed twice as heavily as Mr.
      Rich Man next door, he&rsquo;s interested. He begins to think the paper is a
      devil of a paper. He talks about it. That helps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose The Guardian should attack Us on the tax issue?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That also would be interesting,&rdquo; remarked Dana. &ldquo;But they won&rsquo;t. Our
      trail is too well covered. It would take them a year to get at the facts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what&rsquo;s the young fool driving at, anyway, Dana?&rdquo; The lawyer rubbed
      his long angular jaw, and the somnolent look of his eyes deepened into
      musing. &ldquo;I figure he&rsquo;s making a bid for the radical support. The radicals
      have never had a show here, and he may be able to rally them to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do they amount to, the radicals! A newspaper has got to have the
      support of people with money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the accepted theory,&rdquo; admitted the lawyer. &ldquo;What do you know of
      young Robson&rsquo;s financial status!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite a bit. I handled the sale for Wymett.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; yes. A good bargain for Wymett. Eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A stroke of fortune.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much has Robson got behind him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not much. Twenty thousand. Perhaps twenty-five.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Clark looked relieved. &ldquo;I think we need have no misgivings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure. A paper with radical leanings might find material in
      that transfer ordinance of ours when it comes up again. Even some of our
      good friends balk at that as pretty raw.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An essential step to our expansion, Dana,&rdquo; said the public utilitarian
      blandly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly. But an uncharitable mind mightn&rsquo;t see it that way. Which reminds
      me: Embree is threatening a legislative investigation if the ordinance
      goes through.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Local matters are no affair of Embree&rsquo;s,&rdquo; declared the other angrily.
      &ldquo;Fortunately he has no newspaper backing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has n&rsquo;t he? I wish I were sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think that young Robson has sold out to Embree already?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, then&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not sold out. It is n&rsquo;t a question of cash. This boy is n&rsquo;t A. M.
      Wymett.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nevertheless a newspaper is a business proposition,&rdquo; opined Montrose
      Clark dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It ought to be. Much simpler if it were. But this boy is a bit of a
      sentimentalist. I&rsquo;m afraid he&rsquo;s in the way of being influenced by Smiling
      Mart&rsquo;s line of clap-trap.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we must act promptly.&rdquo; The public utilitarian sat, thoughtful.
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll start a campaign of public education on the transfer question,
      through the newspapers,&rdquo; he decided. &ldquo;Including, of course, The Guardian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Straight-out, a-d-v kind of advertising?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hardly. The usual thing. Well-prepared articles. Perhaps a careful
      editorial or two. Do you think it too early?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not too early. Too late for The Guardian. It won&rsquo;t take &rsquo;em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I think it will,&rdquo; returned the other comfortably. &ldquo;At our special
      rate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at any price, the editorials. The &lsquo;readers,&rsquo; yes. But they&rsquo;ll have
      the &lsquo;a-d-v&rsquo; sign at the bottom. Maybe the &lsquo;P.-U.&rsquo; trade-mark also.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montrose Clark&rsquo;s face puffed red. &ldquo;Where do you get your information?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From inside,&rdquo; answered Dana, whose special virtue and value was to be
      &ldquo;inside&rdquo; on all available sources of information. &ldquo;Those are the new
      orders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Robson&rsquo;s?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose so. Andrew Galpin may have a hand in it. He&rsquo;s in general
      charge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I can persuade those young gentlemen,&rdquo; remarked Montrose Clark
      sardonically, &ldquo;that it is not to their interest to impose troublesome
      restrictions upon the corporation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pressed a button. There arrived upon the scene, with an effect of
      automatic response, that smooth, flawless, noiseless, expressionless piece
      of human mechanism, Edward Garson, the hand-perfected private secretary
      who, besides his immediate duties about the great man&rsquo;s person, acted as
      go-between in minor matters, press-agent, and advertising manager for the
      Fenchester Public Utilities Corporation. Concerning him, Judge Dana had
      once remarked that the queerest thing about it was that it also had
      brains.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Garson,&rdquo; barked Montrose Clark, in the tone which he deemed appropriate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hand-perfected secretary bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bring in The Guardian advertising account.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The secretary bowed again and disappeared. Almost immediately he was back,
      bowing once more over a neatly typed single sheet of paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is our total expenditure in The Guardian for the current year, up to
      date?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For display advertising, eleven hundred and forty-seven dollars, sixty
      cents. For reading matter, two hundred and seventy-five.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That includes editorial matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And in The Record?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seventeen hundred and twenty, sir. All display. They make no charge for
      editorials or readers, you recall, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True. We pay them a higher rate for display, and the editorial support is&mdash;er&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By way of gratitude,&rdquo; suggested Dana.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly. Do you think, Dana, that either paper is in a position to
      discard the P.-U.&lsquo;s support?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just a moment,&rdquo; said the lawyer. &ldquo;That display advertising bill of The
      Guardian&rsquo;s; what was the bill as rendered?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Looking to Montrose Clark for permission and receiving it in a nod, the
      hand-perfected secretary replied, &ldquo;Sixteen hundred dollars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Scaled down to a net of about eleven hundred and fifty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. With discounts and rebates.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wymett fooled Robson worse than I had supposed. The young fool bought on
      the basis of the book rates. Discounts and rebates are going to be an
      unpleasant surprise to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All of which will make him the easier to handle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe. With gloves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not my habit,&rdquo; said the local potentate austerely, &ldquo;to concern
      myself deeply with other people&rsquo;s over-sensitiveness, when it is a matter
      of business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go easy with him,&rdquo; insisted the other. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s got a temper. There&rsquo;s a kind
      of a you-be-damned-ness about him. He&rsquo;s a little puffed up with his new
      sense of power, and we&rsquo;ve got to allow for that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sense of power?&rdquo; The magnate looked puzzled for the moment. &ldquo;Oh, you mean
      his paper!&rdquo; He laughed. &ldquo;All right, Dana. I&rsquo;ll be tactful with him. But of
      course I shan&rsquo;t tolerate any nonsense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The retort, &ldquo;I doubt if he will, either,&rdquo; was on the tip of the lawyer&rsquo;s
      tongue. He suppressed it. It would only have irritated Montrose Clark&rsquo;s
      vanity which, under friction, was prone to develop prickly heat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let him find out for himself how to handle human nettles if he could n&rsquo;t
      take cannier men&rsquo;s advice!

      surmise as to Senator Embree and The Guardian partook of the genius of
      prophecy. &ldquo;Smiling Mart&rdquo; had been waiting to assure himself about the new
      control of the paper. Conviction grew within him that Jeremy Robson was
      the man he was looking for: that the seed planted with forethought in the
      mind of the unimportant Record reporter was now bringing forth harvest in
      The Guardian. Embree decided upon open measures.
    </p>
    <p>
      Returning from a hasty luncheon one day, Jeremy found his den irradiated
      by the famous Embree smile. He was glad to see it. At the points of
      intersection where politics and newspaper work cross, he had encountered
      the leader from the Northern Tier perhaps half a dozen times since their
      first interview, and had liked him better each time, though their talks
      had been on the professional and impersonal order. No conversation with
      Martin Embree, however, was ever wholly impersonal. He was too intense a
      humanist for that. As the Legislature had adjourned for the summer, Jeremy
      was surprised to see Embree at the capital.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Senator,&rdquo; he said, shaking hands. &ldquo;What brings you down here in
      all this heat and dust?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You,&rdquo; smiled his visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I apologize. I did n&rsquo;t do it purposely. But I&rsquo;m glad to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So here you are, a real newspaper owner. Congratulations, by the way.&rdquo;
       Jeremy nodded. &ldquo;Do you remember a little talk we had in my room, one
      night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is the next stage in the fairy-tale. Well, I talked pretty openly
      that evening. As a rule I don&rsquo;t give myself away in chance conversation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harking back, Jeremy failed to recall that the rising politician had given
      himself away, in any sense. He leaned back in his chair and waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been watching your course with The Guardian,&rdquo; continued the Senator
      earnestly. &ldquo;I wanted to see which way you were going. Now I know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What convinced you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your editorial on the tax-dodging railroads. That,&rdquo; said Senator Embree,
      his brilliant smile playing again, &ldquo;was a soaker. A soaker! I expect you
      heard from that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did they yelp?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Threaten?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What could they threaten?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s true; what could they?&rdquo; repeated the other thoughtfully. &ldquo;They
      would n&rsquo;t know where to have you. You&rsquo;re an undetermined quantity to them.
      And as such they don&rsquo;t know your price. Have they tried to find it out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not openly enough to be caught at it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve been trying to get at mine ever since I came to the Legislature
      as a grass-green young kid of an Assemblyman. I guess they&rsquo;ll find out
      yours about the time they find out mine. And, for a further guess, the two
      prices will be about the same. Eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That also is possible,&rdquo; conceded the editor demurely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Record did n&rsquo;t spoil you. I was afraid it might. They&rsquo;re so slick and
      respectable over there! But as soon as you began to get your muscle into
      The Guardian&rsquo;s editorials, I saw which side you were on. And the tax
      attack settled it in my mind that you&rsquo;re for the public and against the
      corporation grafters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m against the corporations when they don&rsquo;t play fair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s good enough for me! They never do play fair. Not in politics.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t go that far,&rdquo; said Jeremy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will,&rdquo; smiled the other. &ldquo;Give you time. You&rsquo;ll come to it. You&rsquo;re
      with us and you&rsquo;re going to be with us stronger and stronger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It depends on who &lsquo;us&rsquo; is, and what policies are involved,&rdquo; replied the
      editor, not wholly pleased at being thus confidently catalogued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The radicals. The clean, common voters who believe that the people should
      run their own government for themselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So far, all right. I&rsquo;m for that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew you were. And here I am.&rdquo; The smile now fairly surcharged the
      little office.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And here you are. What can I do for you, Senator?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wrong, my boy! Wrong for once. It&rsquo;s the other way around.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can you do for me, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The smile was replaced by a look of candor and earnestness. &ldquo;Mr. Robson,
      you&rsquo;ve got to increase the sale of this paper, have n&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can boost the circulation of The Guardian a thousand copies. Perhaps
      fifteen hundred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you take the job of circulation manager?&rdquo; asked Jeremy, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s another point. I&rsquo;ll come to that later. Now, there&rsquo;s no bluff
      about this, Robson. I&rsquo;m in dead earnest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you can tell me how to put on circulation without its costing all I&rsquo;ve
      got&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll cost you nothing. Absolutely nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it will be different from any circulation scheme I&rsquo;ve heard of yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen. Up in the Northern Tier I&rsquo;m strong. They know me. They believe in
      me. If I pass the word that The Guardian is my organ&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Guardian is nobody&rsquo;s organ.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand. The mouthpiece of our policies, I should have said. The
      policies and principles you and I stand for, reform and
      anti-dollar-domination. If I pass that word about The Guardian they&rsquo;ll
      take it like the Bible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There might be something in that,&rdquo; conceded the editor, who knew the
      almost idolatrous quality of Embree&rsquo;s following in his own district.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make no mistake about it. It&rsquo;ll mean four or five hundred copies in my
      own town, and it ought to run to a thousand more in the county outside.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That won&rsquo;t help much in getting local advertising, here in Fenchester.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. But it will help out your foreign advertising.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know so much about the newspaper game?&rdquo; asked the editor,
      struck by the other&rsquo;s use of the technical term. &ldquo;Ever been in it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I study everything that has a bearing on politics in this State. I could
      pretty nearly tell you how much The Guardian stands to lose this year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; said Jeremy, with a wry face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unless you can raise your rates. And I&rsquo;m showing you the way. Right here
      in Fenchester, as soon as the common people are satisfied that you really
      represent their interests, subscriptions will flood you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suspicion of the phrase beset Jeremy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going in for any demagogue,
      yellow journal stuff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody wants you to. Just a decent, clean, fair-minded, progressive
      radicalism. If I can stand up in my next campaign and say honestly that
      there is a newspaper at the State capital, in the stronghold of old-line
      politics and graft, that represents what I stand for, that newspaper is
      going to boom. And I&rsquo;m ready to do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On what terms?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just out of regard for my fascinating personality?&rdquo; Martin Embree&rsquo;s smile
      appeared again, conciliatory, persuasive, earnest. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s understand each
      other, Robson. I&rsquo;m convinced that you&rsquo;re on the level. That&rsquo;s the first
      point. I&rsquo;m convinced that you&rsquo;re honestly a radical, even if you&rsquo;re a mild
      one. That&rsquo;s the Second. Barring differences on minor policies which are
      bound to arise between independent-minded men, you and I stand for the
      same principles. You know my motivating ambition?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The governorship,&rdquo; replied Jeremy innocently.
    </p>
    <p>
      A furrow of annoyance appeared between the lofty brows of the Senator.
      &ldquo;The ambition of my life,&rdquo; he said emphatically, &ldquo;is to serve the people
      of this State by delivering our government out of the clutches of the
      corporations. To that end I will accept any office, high or low, within
      the gift of the voters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oratorical as was the delivery, there was a certain ring of enthusiasm
      which went far to convince the editor. In the years to come, of constant
      alliance with Martin Embree, Robson satisfied himself of the man&rsquo;s
      essential devotion to the cause which he had made his own, a devotion
      second only to the monstrous egotism which subordinated all causes and all
      principles to his own rodent ambition, or, rather, merged and absorbed
      them in that ambition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course; of course,&rdquo; apologized the editor. &ldquo;But you <i>do</i> want to
      be Governor, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to be Governor,&rdquo; was the positive response. &ldquo;Not all their
      money can stop me. This campaign of mine for reelection to the Senate is
      really a preliminary skirmish for the bigger thing. I could be reelected
      without lifting a finger, so far as that goes. But I want to hammer home
      the State issues. And if you and I hammer at the same time, it is n&rsquo;t
      going to do either of us a bit of harm! By the way, you ought to have
      agents on the ground to boost your circulation in the places where I
      campaign. Who&rsquo;s your circulation manager?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A routine scrub. No good. I&rsquo;m shipping him. Do you happen to know of any
      one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I&rsquo;ve got the very man for you, if he&rsquo;ll come. Max Verrall, a live
      wire on The Forreston Tribune. He&rsquo;s a youngster, but a hustler. I think I
      can get him for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take him on your say-so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, let me give you a pointer or two on getting hold of the country
      districts. We&rsquo;re streaky on nationalities out through this State. There&rsquo;s
      a point to play for. Get after their feelings for the home country with a
      tactful editorial or a bit of translated matter now and then if you can
      lay your hands on it. Tickle their little vanities. That&rsquo;s what I do on my
      speaking tours. If it&rsquo;s a Swedish community, I tell &rsquo;em the
      Scandahoovians are the backbone of the Middle West. In a German district&mdash;and
      the State is thick with &rsquo;em&mdash;I boost German efficiency, the
      system to which the rest of the world goes to school.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speaking of Germans <i>and</i> schools,&rdquo; remarked Robson; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m told that
      they don&rsquo;t even teach in English in some of the country districts. I&rsquo;ve
      been thinking of starting a campaign on that, one of these days.
      Americanization&mdash;that ought to be a good slogan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Off it, my boy!&rdquo; said the Senator emphatically. &ldquo;Hara-kiri is cheaper.
      Nobody is so touchy as your German-American on the subject of language and
      race. Don&rsquo;t butt into a stone wall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wymett had a pet theory that Germany is getting ready for a world-war and
      the German-Americans are already at their propaganda to influence this
      country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bosh! I never could quite make out whether Wymett was more crazy than
      crooked, or <i>vice versa</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just the same, I&rsquo;ve noticed that quite a little reprint stuff boosting
      Germany drifts into this office. Anecdotes about the Kaiser and that sort
      of thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Print &rsquo;em! Print &rsquo;em all. It&rsquo;ll make the paper solid just
      where you most need support.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I do, some of &rsquo;em, on their merits. It&rsquo;s good stuff when
      fillers are needed. Only, when the propaganda side is too plain, I can
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get your mind off this propaganda notion,&rdquo; pleaded his adviser. &ldquo;The
      Germans are the best element of our citizenship to-day, and any man or
      institution that goes up against them is <i>through</i>. Some lunatics are
      trying to make a political issue of it. Magnus Laurens is. And they&rsquo;re
      talking of running him for Governor next time, because they think they&rsquo;ll
      need a respectable figurehead rather than one of the old, discredited gang
      to beat me with. Lord! I&rsquo;d ask nothing better than to have Laurens against
      me, with his crank Know-Nothing conservatism that he calls Americanism.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I liked Mr. Laurens,&rdquo; said Jeremy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t when you&rsquo;ve fought him as long as I have. Speaking of Germans,
      do you know Emil Bausch?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only by sight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s president of the Fenchester Deutscher Club and a mighty good friend
      of mine. He wants to get in touch with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He called once, but I was out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bausch is a little ponderous at first, but he&rsquo;s all right when you get
      used to his ways. And he&rsquo;s a power among the Germans. Don&rsquo;t forget that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Between you and Wymett and Eli Wade I&rsquo;m not likely to forget the
      Germans,&rdquo; laughed Jeremy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wade? Poor chap. That was an unfortunate thing, that row of his. Well,
      he&rsquo;s good on the feet, but weak in the head. Do you know Milliken, his
      crony?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. He has n&rsquo;t much use for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So he tells me every time he sees me. He considers me a slinker because
      he says I&rsquo;m a Socialist at heart, but my heart is weak. Socialism is all
      right in its way. It&rsquo;s a good vaccination, but a bad disease. Milliken&rsquo;s
      working in your shop now, is n&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he? I did n&rsquo;t know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stick to me and you&rsquo;ll learn a lot of things,&rdquo; smiled the politician.
      &ldquo;Yes; he&rsquo;s assistant to Big Girdner in the press-room. There&rsquo;s another
      German for you, Girdner, and a good one. Well, I&rsquo;ll tell Emil Bausch to
      come in again to see you.&rdquo; At the door he paused. &ldquo;By the way, are you
      likely to be interested personally in politics?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Office for myself? No. I&rsquo;ve got my hands full now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Later, perhaps. Well, if you should want anything for any of your
      friends, let me know. Perhaps I could manage it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could you? Locally?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a little influence locally, as a member of the Cities Improvement
      Committee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were speaking of Eli Wade a moment ago,&rdquo; said Jeremy. &ldquo;Something I
      wrote in The Record helped to get him out of a job he was very proud of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Public Schools Board? Yes: I know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was tough on the old boy. I&rsquo;d like to make that up to him. Do you
      think you could get him put back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hardly that. You see, he got the Germans stirred up. He was out of place
      on the Board, anyway. Education is the special political bent of the
      German-Americans, you know. No; I&rsquo;m afraid he&rsquo;s finished there. But I
      might look around and see if there is n&rsquo;t something else that would be
      just as good for him. It&rsquo;s just the little honor of having an office that
      flatters his type of mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d be mightily obliged if you could,&rdquo; said Jeremy. Martin Embree lost no
      time on the Bausch matter. On the morrow of his interview with Jeremy,
      there stalked into the editorial den of The Guardian, a tall, plethoric
      form buttoned within the frock coat and wearing the silk hat of high
      ceremony. The form introduced itself with a pronounced guttural accent as
      President Bausch, of the Deutscher Club, removed the hat, unbuttoned the
      coat, took from the breast-pocket thereof a document formidable with seals
      and tape, dandled the precious thing reverently in its hands, and
      addressed the editor with solemnity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have here somedthing of grade importance for your paper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take a seat,&rdquo; offered the editor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The document-bearer complied. &ldquo;Id is a ledder from Prindz Henry to the
      Cherman Singing Societies of America.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The original?&rdquo; asked Jeremy, regarding the waxed and tapered curio with
      interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not! The orichinal is mounted and framed in New York. This is
      the official copy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It certainly looks official.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Id iss to be printed on Ventzday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean that it is released for Wednesday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Id iss to be printed on Ventzday,&rdquo; reiterated the solemn emissary. &ldquo;It
      should appear on your frondt page.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Had Mr. Bausch but known it, this landed him full upon the editor&rsquo;s pet
      toe: a toe, moreover, by this time angrily sore from over-frequent
      treadings. It was no time to be telling the new proprietor and editor of
      that free and untrammeled organ, The Guardian, what to and what not to
      print, or where to locate it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will if it&rsquo;s worth it.&rdquo; stated that gentleman briefly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wordth? Id iss <i>most</i> important,&rdquo; his visitor assured him. &ldquo;I have
      also here the material from which could be derifed a valuable editorial&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t really see that such a letter, even though it be news, is a
      subject for editorial comment in The Guardian,&rdquo; said Jeremy impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you understand <i>whoo</i> this ledder iss from?&rdquo; cried the other.
      &ldquo;Prindz Henry! Our Kaiser&rsquo;s brother. And you tell me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whose Kaiser&rsquo;s brother? Not mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An incredulous and pious shock passed over the face of Mr. Emil Bausch.
      &ldquo;Not yours! What matters you? The Kaiser of all goodt Chermans.&rdquo; He
      contemplated the young man with gloomy severity. &ldquo;If id was the Prindz of
      Vales I will bet you prindt it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Unversed in the carefully inbred German hatred and jealousy of all things
      British, Jeremy was mildly puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why so?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I bet you are a Inklish-lover. I bet you are a Cherman-hater. You would
      prindt the Prindz of Vales ledder. Hein?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just as much or as little as I shall print of this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As liddle? You will edit <i>this</i>; Prindz Henry&rsquo;s own words?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If there&rsquo;s too much of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dumbfounded at the proposed sacrilege, Mr. Bausch retrieved the precious
      roll and held it ready to thrust back into the pocket of the frock coat.
      &ldquo;All or nothing,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will rebort this at the next meeting of the Deutscher Club,&rdquo; growled
      the departing Teuton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Send us a copy of the minutes,&rdquo; retorted the exasperated Jem. &ldquo;Perhaps
      we&rsquo;ll give you an editorial on those.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He finished his writing and leaned back to meditate upon the possible
      results of this encounter when a well-remembered voice in the hall spoke
      his name, in a tone of business-like inquiry, to the youth on duty there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come right in, Buddy,&rdquo; called Jeremy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Buddy Higman entered. He was dressed with extreme correctness, even to the
      extent of a whole and intact pair of suspenders, and his Sunday coat which
      he carried genteelly over his arm. Jeremy pointed an accusing finger at
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know what you&rsquo;ve come here for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gee!&rdquo; murmured Buddy, impressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve come to tell me how to run my paper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me?&rdquo; said Buddy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or to order something put in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or kept out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; said the astounded Buddy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!! Don&rsquo;t you know how to run my paper better than I do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;N-n-no, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you&rsquo;re unique in this town. Come to my arms. I mean, sit down.
      What&rsquo;s that you&rsquo;re trying to get out of your pocket?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A&mdash;a&mdash;a letter, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hah! I knew it. From the Kaiser!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir. I don&rsquo;t know him,&rdquo; said Buddy nervously. &ldquo;What are you calling
      me &lsquo;sir&rsquo; for?&rdquo; demanded Jeremy, suspicious at this unaccustomed courtesy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want a job.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you want a job! Here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you good for in a newspaper office?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a fine recommendation. Do you expect to get the job on the
      strength of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir. No, sir. On this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After much painful struggling the urchin succeeded in extracting from his
      pocket a note which he placed in Jeremy&rsquo;s hands. At sight of it, all
      residue of raillery died out of the editor&rsquo;s face. Though he had but once
      seen Marcia&rsquo;s writing, he knew, at the first glance, the bold, frank,
      delicate, upright characters for hers. The note was undated. He read, with
      a feeling that the world had changed and sweetened about him, her words.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Dear Jem: </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      If you ever can, give Buddy a chance; some work that will not interfere
      with his schooling. I wish you two to look after each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, oh, my dear, do please not quite altogether forget
    </p>
    <p>
      Marcia
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy sat in a long silence. The boy did not disturb it. Finally the
      young man looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When did she give you this, Buddy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before she went away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. You get the job.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks. I knew I would,&rdquo; said the urchin confidently. &ldquo;I c&rsquo;n start in
      to-morrow.&rdquo; He watched, sympathetically, the other fold the note and
      bestow it in his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Robson,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;She said a queer thing when she gimme the letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She said&mdash;you know how her eyes get solemn and big and&mdash;and
      kinda light up, deep inside, when she means a thing <i>hard</i>&mdash;she
      said, &lsquo;Buddy, I shall like to think that you and he are looking after each
      other.&rsquo; What did she mean by that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;ll have to think it over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I been thinkin&rsquo; it over an&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t get it.&rdquo; He paused. Then with
      the self-centered simplicity of boyhood, &ldquo;Mr. Robson, I miss her somethin&rsquo;
      fierce. You don&rsquo;t know how I miss her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I!&rdquo; retorted Jeremy involuntarily, with a stab of pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody could,&rdquo; stated the other with conviction.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Jeremy and Buddy Higman became fellow-workers. Buddy&rsquo;s job was
      decidedly indeterminate. It did n&rsquo;t matter. In taking him on Jeremy was
      performing his first definite service to Marcia.
    </p>
    <p>
      A week later his second was completed. Eli Wade was appointed a member of
      the Library Board. The Guardian chronicled the appointment more
      conspicuously than its unimportance as news warranted. Jeremy hoped that
      in some manner Marcia would see or hear of it.

      CHAPTER IV
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>ARTIN EMBREE more
      than fulfilled his word.
    </p>
    <p>
      As if a royal patent had been issued in favor of The Guardian, the
      Senator&rsquo;s zealous partisans of the Northern Tier bestowed upon it their
      patronage. Max Verrall, who revealed himself as a brisk and unfettered
      spirit with political ambitions and a slavish fervency for Embree, did the
      actual work of establishing the circulation in the district, and did it so
      well that Jeremy Robson had no misgivings in turning over to him the
      circulation managership of the paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Fenchester the paper held about even for a time. The new features which
      Galpin had put on gained readers, though not as fast as he had hoped. To
      offset this, there had been some loss among the more rabid element of the
      Deutscher Club, Bausch having spread the report that the new ownership was
      anti-German. On his next visit to Fenchester, to deliver the formal
      address at a school dedication, Senator Embree reproached Jeremy for his
      tactlessness in handling the Prince Henry message.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stick your fighting-jaw out at me, young Robson,&rdquo; he added
      cheerily. &ldquo;Keep that for your enemies. Now you put in a nice,
      good-tempered philosophic little editorial paragraph on the &lsquo;entente
      cordiale&rsquo; line.&rdquo; Jeremy began. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m da&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you&rsquo;re not,&rdquo; broke in the other. &ldquo;Listen. Here&rsquo;s the idea.&rdquo; And he
      outlined an editorial so tactful, so deft, so diplomatic whilst still
      independently American in tone, that for sheer pleasure in good
      workmanship the editor agreed to adopt it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll square it with Bausch,&rdquo; said Embree. His smile expanded and
      enfolded the other. &ldquo;Better come hear me speak to-night. I &lsquo;ll have
      something to say about The Guardian. Watch the effect of the spread of the
      gospel for the next few days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The one brief reference to the paper in Senator Embree&rsquo;s address said
      little but implied much. Jeremy was inclined to be disappointed. He looked
      for no results. But the following day brought in thirty-seven new
      subscriptions, with others trailing in their wake at the rate of a dozen
      per day. Furthermore, a batch of letters to the editor urged upon him a
      more definite political stand, or invited (in one instance challenged) him
      to state his attitude regarding Embree and the new policies frankly. Since
      his taking over the paper, politics had been at slack tide in the State.
      Jeremy had wisely refrained from committing himself definitely. All his
      instinct was for independence of thought and speech. When the issues were
      cast, The Guardian would take its stand. But he had reckoned without that
      pervasive and acute political self-consciousness of the Middle West which
      expects every citizen to be definitely one thing or the other, and be it
      promptly! His tax editorials, he found, had already committed him in the
      general mind to the radical side. Whoever attacked the railroads was a
      Friend of the People. To be sure, Jeremy&rsquo;s attack had been addressed to a
      few specific and flagrant instances; but the public does not discriminate
      finely. And Senator Embree&rsquo;s word-of-mouth &ldquo;gospel&rdquo; had already premised
      for The Guardian a course which would considerably have surprised its
      proprietor.
    </p>
    <p>
      That keen-scented legal prowler, Judge Selden Dana, became uneasy. Young
      Robson, he feared, was getting deep into &ldquo;Smiling Mart&rsquo;s&rdquo; toils.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time we took a hand,&rdquo; he warned Montrose Clark. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think I&rsquo;d
      better see Robson and have a talk with him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will do it myself,&rdquo; said the public utilitarian. &ldquo;I have had more
      experience than you in handling newspaper men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. But&mdash;easy does it. Remember, this is no A. M. Wymett.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it were, I should leave it entirely in your hands,&rdquo; retorted the
      magnate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Judge Dana left, reflecting pungently upon his employer&rsquo;s capacity for
      unnecessarily disagreeable speeches.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he tries that on Robson he&rsquo;ll get bumped, or I miss my guess,&rdquo; he
      surmised, and found some satisfaction in the thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing, however, could have been farther from the mind of President
      Clark. He purposed treating the young newspaper man kindly. Firmly, but
      kindly. Even benevolently. Point out to him the error he was committing:
      show him that he was unwittingly an enemy to civic interests and progress
      which could best be left to those equipped by experience and under
      Providence, for handling large affairs: indicate to him, delicately,
      wherein his own interests and those of his newspaper were consonant with
      the interests of such public benefactors as Montrose Clark and the P.-U.
      That was the way to handle a presumably reasonable young fellow with a
      property to consider! In his satisfied mind, the public utilitarian
      outlined the course of the conversation, with himself (naturally) as
      converser and his visitor contributing the antiphony of grateful assent.
      Summoning the hand-perfected private secretary, Mr. Clark entrusted to his
      reverent care a summons for Mr. Jeremy Robson.
    </p>
    <p>
      The message was duly transferred to the &rsquo;phone. It found the editor
      imparting some instructions to his new office boy and loyal personal
      heeler, Burton Higman. At the call which informed him that the Fenchester
      P.-U. Corporation office was on the &rsquo;phone, Jeremy&rsquo;s mind reverted
      to the interview of some months before when Mr. Montrose Clark had issued
      his god-like directions to the fuming but helpless &ldquo;rippawtah&rdquo; from The
      Record, and an unholy light shone in his eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is Mr. Garson, Mr. Montrose Clark&rsquo;s private secretary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go ahead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Clark wishes to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that necessary?&rdquo; queried the voice, in a tone of startled rebuke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s usual.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will doubtless explain, himself,&rdquo; said the voice, after a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Jeremy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three o&rsquo;clock this afternoon,&rdquo; specified the great man&rsquo;s mouthpiece, and
      shut off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the Montrose Clark method with inferiors. Time and the wish were
      stated. The place was assumed. A newspaper man was a natural inferior
      according to the Montrose Clark measure. The weak point of the theory, in
      this instance, was that the other party to the transaction had not
      subscribed to it. He returned to his writing. At three-ten the
      hand-perfected private secretary was on the &rsquo;phone again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Garson speaking. Mr. Clark is waiting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So am I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo; The tone was incredulous. &ldquo;Put Mr. Clark on the
      &lsquo;phone,&rdquo; suggested the editor. &ldquo;He may be quicker of comprehension.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The suggestion was not adopted. But in fifteen minutes the secretary, one
      button of his black cutaway flagrantly unbuttoned, was being admitted to
      the den by Buddy Higman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is most extraordinary, Mr. Robson,&rdquo; he protested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s extraordinary in it? Mr. Clark wants to see me on business, I
      assume?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is my place of business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is&mdash;you&mdash;you are going out of your way to be offensive,&rdquo;
       accused the scandalized visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not going out of my way at all. I&rsquo;m sitting tight. You might have noticed
      that yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Clark&mdash;that is to say, the Public Utilities Corporation has been
      a good friend to The Guardian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been reciprocated in the past,&rdquo; returned Jeremy dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the past? Am I to understand that the attitude of The Guardian toward
      the Corporation has changed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Mr. Wymett was accustomed to run around whenever Mr. Clark chose to
      push a button, it has. Them good old days,&rdquo; said Jeremy enjoyably, &ldquo;is
      gone forever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Wymett returned courtesy for courtesies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So shall I. When I receive the courtesies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The advertising patronage&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk to me about advertising,&rdquo; broke in the editor. &ldquo;The few
      dollars that your concern pays into our cash drawer don&rsquo;t entitle Mr.
      Clark to regard this paper as his errand boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Garson&rsquo;s sensitive ear fixed upon the word &ldquo;few.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are n&rsquo;t doing much advertising anywhere just now,&rdquo; he explained with a
      conciliating purr. &ldquo;There will be more soon. Quite soon, in fact. But
      there were other ways, you understand, in which Mr. Clark&rsquo;s friendship was
      useful to The Guardian&mdash;to Mr. Wymett.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For example?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;News items. Inside information. Advance information, I may say, on the
      stock market, for instance, amounting to really advantageous
      opportunities.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such information is still&mdash;er&mdash;available.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see, again. Would Mr. Clark confirm the proposition, do you think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The hand-perfected private secretary beamed. His mission, self-inspired,
      was prospering famously. &ldquo;Undoubtedly,&rdquo; he averred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In writing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Clark&rsquo;s word is&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As good as his bond. Naturally. I was merely thinking of such a letter
      not necessarily as a guarantee of good faith, but for publication.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A thin, gray veil appeared to draw itself across Mr. Garson&rsquo;s countenance,
      out of which his eyes stared with an aspect of surprise and fright. This
      animal had claws! &ldquo;For publication?&rdquo; he gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it. You don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;d do it? Well, he&rsquo;s wise&mdash;to that
      extent, anyway. Now, you go back and tell Clark that when we open up for
      bribes we&rsquo;ll take cash&mdash;and publish the news in the paper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you do to little Eddie Garson?&rdquo; asked Andrew Galpin, coming in a
      moment later. &ldquo;I just met him in the hall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a rude thing!&rdquo; grinned the general manager. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your idea in
      going up against the P.-U.?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Partly personal,&rdquo; confessed Jeremy. &ldquo;That puffy Clark thing rasps my
      nerves. Anyway, I don&rsquo;t like the P.-U. methods, public or private, and I&rsquo;m
      not going to stand any bulldozing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Going to fight?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it comes to that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Know what it&rsquo;ll cost us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More than a thousand a year if they pull out all their regular
      advertising.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s tough, Andy. But I don&rsquo;t know any other way to run a paper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m not kickin&rsquo;! It ain&rsquo;t my money. I enjoy it. Maybe he won&rsquo;t pull
      out, unless we go after him first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going after him, though, the next raw deal the P.-U. tries to put
      through.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s pray they&rsquo;ll be good, then,&rdquo; said Galpin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon receipt of the hand-perfected private secretary&rsquo;s report, though it
      was carefully edited to avoid too unbearable offense, Mr. Clark waxed
      exceedingly wroth. His first intent was to order all future advertising in
      The Guardian stopped. Passion always had the first word with Montrose
      Clark, but shrewdness had the last. Shrewdness said, &ldquo;Wait.&rdquo; Montrose
      Clark could be a good waiter. He waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy Robson did n&rsquo;t. He published on the following day an editorial,
      &ldquo;Public Utilities and Public Rights,&rdquo; stating unequivocally The Guardian&rsquo;s
      attitude, which gave deep scandal to President Clark and inspired the
      darkest misgivings in the mind of the diplomatic Judge Dana. The lawyer
      hurried around to see his principal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you do or say to young Robson?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outraged innocence sat blackly on the presidential brow. &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; he
      declared. &ldquo;He&mdash;he sent me an insulting message. He refused to come
      and see me. I&rsquo;ll smash him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very likely. Meantime he&rsquo;s smashed our transfer scheme. Or he will smash
      it when the time comes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall go ahead with it just the same.&rdquo;
     </p>

      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be swamped. He&rsquo;s dug up some tax assessment material on us that
      would n&rsquo;t look pretty in print if he sprung it now. We&rsquo;ll have to go
      slow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The President of the P.-U. swallowed his desire for immediate reprisals.
      He felt that his prey was sure in the long run. No newspaper could offend
      consistently the important people and interests of a community as The
      Guardian was doing, and continue to make a living. That way bankruptcy
      lay!

    <p>
      Personally, Montrose Clark declared against this young upstart a war of
      extermination. He would eliminate the noxious creature. He would make the
      town too hot for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vast would have been his rage could he have known that, at the same time,
      the editor was meditating much the same design concerning himself. War to
      the finish, on both sides. And all, in the first instance, because of a
      minor affectation expressed in the pronunciation of the hybrid word
      &ldquo;rippawtah.&rdquo; Of such petty stuff are human complications constructed, and
      thereby the plans of the mighty brought to dust!

      CHAPTER V
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">P</span>OLITICS as such
      had never greatly interested Jeremy Robson. The trivial and blatant
      insincerities of party platforms offended a mind naturally direct and
      sincere. As he saw the game played at the Capitol, it seemed to consist
      mainly in clumsy finesse directed to unprofitable ends, on the part of the
      lawmakers, back of whom sat the little tin gods of finance and commerce,
      as players sit back of the pieces on a chessboard. Only, it dawned upon
      Jeremy, in this game it was the public that paid the stakes; the public
      which Jeremy intended that The Guardian should represent. His platform was
      &ldquo;Fair play all around and a chance for all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Being of such mind, he was naturally sympathetic to the fervent and
      altruistic radicalism of Senator Embree. Almost before he knew it, he was
      committed to the broad, general policies of a new faction whose immediate
      object was to capture the party machinery and elect Embree Governor.
      Farmers, the more thoughtful class of labor in the industrial centers, and
      that floating vote which is always restless of party control, made up the
      bulk of &ldquo;Smiling Mart&rsquo;s&rdquo; support. His newspaper backing was scanty. In
      Bellair, the chief city of Centralia, The Journal lent its valuable
      support to most of his measures and to his general policies. A score of
      country journals were thick-and-thin adherents. The Guardian soon began to
      be classed with these for loyalty and with the Bellair Journal for
      weightiness, in support of the new movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy Robson&rsquo;s spirited editorial attacks upon the controlled State
      administration were now establishing his paper as a gospel to the
      fermenting political elements, and had earned the indignant distrust of
      those interests which base loud claims to impregnable respectability upon
      the ground of returning reliable dividends to their stockholders. To these
      he was anathema; a &ldquo;dangerous radical,&rdquo; a &ldquo;half-Socialist,&rdquo; an &ldquo;enemy of
      American institutions,&rdquo; a &ldquo;confessed demagogue,&rdquo; and the like impressive
      and silly characterizations. The Guardian was quoted, confuted, and abused
      over the State. It had become a power.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Jeremy and Andrew Galpin and their lesser aides were struggling with
      the various immediate and insistent problems of a newspaper&rsquo;s existence
      and sustenance, and establishing their organ before the public as
      genuinely independent in thought and unhampered in the expression of it,
      political prestige, which is not acquired in a day by a newspaper any more
      than by an individual, steadily accrued to it. Jeremy Robson had owned The
      Guardian for a year before he fully realized his political
      responsibilities in that what was said editorially in his paper greatly
      mattered to some thousands of earnest and groping minds. Not only this. He
      himself mattered, individually, as controlling The Guardian. His visiting
      list became inconveniently large. People took to dropping in at the office
      to discuss, advise, approve, or object, particularly visitors from the
      outlying districts who deemed it an all-sufficient introduction to state
      that they were &ldquo;friends of Mart Embree.&rdquo; Whether through the direct
      procurement of that energetic campaigner or otherwise, Jeremy found that
      The Guardian was considered to be not only the representative but the
      proprietary organ of the new movement. Financially this was an important
      asset. Nevertheless, the editor disrelished it. Remembering A. M. Wymett&rsquo;s
      disquisition, he heartily resented his newspaper&rsquo;s being regarded as the
      horn to any one&rsquo;s phonograph! Moreover, all these calls ate up time. But
      that paid for itself in widened acquaintance and a more sympathetic
      understanding of the people who, after all, made up the Commonwealth cf
      Centralia. He made friends readily with them. They liked him as soon as
      they adjusted themselves to the shock of his apparel which they deemed
      dudish.
    </p>
    <p>
      The World-War was still more than a year distant, still but the dream of
      such pessimistic and flighty minds as A. M. Wymett&rsquo;s, when politics began
      to boil again in Centralia, and in that steaming stew of policies,
      principles, pretenses, ambitions, and chicaneries there simmered, all
      unseen, one of the minor but far-spread schemes of the Teutonic war-lord&rsquo;s
      propaganda. It came to Jeremy&rsquo;s ears through a call from Magnus Laurens,
      already being talked of as opposition candidate to Martin Embree, and
      already the subject of frank rather than well-judged comment, in the pages
      of The Guardian, as representing franchise-holding control of government.
      The water-power magnate looked squarer, ruggeder, more determined and
      formidable even than on the occasion when Jeremy had first seen him grimly
      facing the ridicule of the German societies. He was nearer sixty than
      fifty and walked like a football captain, and the blue eyes under the
      severe brows, as they met Jeremy&rsquo;s, were alert and hard. The editor rose
      to greet him, holding out his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did n&rsquo;t come here to shake your hand,&rdquo; said Laurens quietly. &ldquo;I came to
      tell you something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy sat down. &ldquo;Tell ahead,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo; ve been using my name too freely in your paper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a public character.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name is my own. I&rsquo;m particular about it. I keep it clean. Your paper
      has coupled it up with names that are n&rsquo;t clean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I choose your political associates, Mr. Laurens?&rdquo; said Jeremy keenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Political criticism is one thing. Innuendoes of crookedness and graft are
      another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll reach no common ground as regards your waterpower operations. I&rsquo;m
      against you there. You&rsquo;re selling to the people, at a profit, power that
      should belong to them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s theory. With that I&rsquo;ve no quarrel. But when your paper moralizes
      about franchise-grafting, and hints at bribery, leave me out of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The editor reflected. On Martin Embree&rsquo;s representations, he had assumed
      Laurens&rsquo;s operations to be founded in corruption. But what proof had he,
      after all?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Dollard&rsquo;s Falls Charter&mdash;&rdquo; he began and was cut short.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The records are open to you. The books of the company are open to you.
      I&rsquo;ll even go that far, if it&rsquo;s facts you&rsquo;re after. Or is it hush-money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which do you think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The hard, blue eyes looked at him with a more interested scrutiny. Magnus
      Laurens grunted. &ldquo;Bird of a different feather from Wymett,&rdquo; he surmised
      doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m different from Sellers and Corey and Bellows and that lot. Bear
      that in mind. If you couple me up with them again, I&rsquo;ll be back here for
      <i>real</i> trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Coming back to lick the editor?&rdquo; asked Jeremy, contemplating the
      muscle-packed figure of the other with a smile. &ldquo;If so, I&rsquo;ll lay in a
      length of lead pipe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lay in a lawyer and a good one,&rdquo; advised the visitor grimly. &ldquo;For I&rsquo;ll be
      after you for criminal libel. No fiddling little damage suits for me.
      That&rsquo;s what I came to tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. I&rsquo;ve got it. Anything else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s my turn. You control the Oak Lodge Pulp Company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have an interest in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Guardian buys its print paper from you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you came here did you have in mind any&mdash;well, exchange of
      courtesies, editorial for business consideration, in respect to future
      deals?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not. I don&rsquo;t do business that way,&rdquo; retorted Magnus Laurens with
      emphasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you think that perhaps I was aiming in that direction, with my
      comments on you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The magnate changed color a little. &ldquo;I might have suspected something of
      the sort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. I was wrong. Anything else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. If I&rsquo;ll undertake that The Guardian shall say nothing more along the
      line which you find objectionable without specific and definite charges
      taken from the records, will you acquit me&mdash;that is, will you
      consider that you&rsquo;ve scared me sufficiently?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Magnus Laurens blinked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a fool,&rdquo; he said presently. &ldquo;Scared you?
      You&rsquo;re no more afraid of me than I am of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ve done better than scare me. You&rsquo;ve convinced me that you mean
      what you say. You and I can fight fair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll shake hands now,&rdquo; said Laurens, and did. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re all wrong. You&rsquo;ve
      been misled by that quack, Embree. But I suppose a man can be wrong and
      still be straight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly what I&rsquo;m supposing about you,&rdquo; retorted Jeremy. &ldquo;Now, sit down,
      Mr. Laurens, and tell me some real political news.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laurens drew a chair up opposite the editor. &ldquo;Do you think you&rsquo;d print
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;News is The Guardian&rsquo;s stock in trade.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s some, then. A bill is going to be introduced this fall to
      Germanize our public schools farther.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the substance of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Making German practically compulsory in the grade schools.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll never pass it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Watch them! What leader is going to oppose it? In a governorship election
      year?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who will introduce it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some nonentity. It will have the most powerful radical support. You can
      guess from whom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t guess, professionally.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll tell you. Martin Embree.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask him. My sources of information are reliable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I get a copy of the bill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a rough outline of it. It is n&rsquo;t fully decided on yet, as to
      details.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who drew it up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Reverend Theo Gunst, Henry Dolge, and Professor Brender, of the
      German Department at Old Central, on the basis of a plan which Herr
      Professor Koerner left when he was here. It&rsquo;s one of the moves in the
      development of &lsquo;Deutschturn.&rsquo; Have you ever seen the Germanizing scheme
      for Centralia gotten up in the eighties?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I&rsquo;ve heard there was such a thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Colonization up to a certain point. Then the establishment of a Little
      Germany through making German the official language of the schools, the
      courts, and the Legislature. Peaceful conquest idea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this bill is a revival of that plan, you think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has that appearance. Will The Guardian support it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will it oppose it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s doing this interviewing, you or me, Mr. Laurens?&rdquo; smiled Jeremy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call it an exchange.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. Yes: we&rsquo;ll oppose it. What about you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s well enough known where I stand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As a private citizen, yes. But as candidate for Governor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not a candidate for Governor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not formally. But you&rsquo;re going to be. What about this German school bill
      then? Will you oppose it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I certainly won&rsquo;t dodge it. Are you going to pass on this conversation to
      &lsquo;Smiling Mart&rsquo; Embree?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not if it&rsquo;s confidential.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I think this latter part is, for the present. To be quite frank, I
      don&rsquo;t want to meet that issue till I have to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right. It&rsquo;ll probably beat you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Possibly. But if the issue is once raised, it won&rsquo;t die out of people&rsquo;s
      minds readily. That&rsquo;s something.&rdquo; He paused, then added casually: &ldquo;By the
      way, our first meeting was in a pretty German atmosphere. Do you recall
      the meeting where little Miss Ames stood up for the flag? That took
      character.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy&rsquo;s face became wistful. &ldquo;Do you ever hear from her&mdash;Miss Ames?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh? My daughter does. Did you&mdash;Why, you were the one that put her on
      the golf team, were n&rsquo;t you! I&rsquo;d forgotten. You must be a good teacher.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was a good pupil. Never knew when she was beaten.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It didn&rsquo;t happen often enough for her to know, I guess,&rdquo; laughed the
      magnate. &ldquo;She came out to visit Elizabeth and made a fool of me on my own
      course. I owe you a grudge for that, young man! Will you take me out and
      show me some of the tricks some time when I&rsquo;m down here? We&rsquo;ll talk
      politics while we go around, so you can soothe your conscience for taking
      the time off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glad to. Miss Ames and I used to play in the early morning, but I guess I
      can take an afternoon off when you come down. By the way, where is she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In Hamburg, I believe. There was some hint of an engagement.&mdash;a
      relative of her stepfather&rsquo;s, I believe. Very advantageous match.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy heard the reply &ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo; in a tone of flat and polite
      simulation of interest, issue upon the air. It was obviously the result of
      a mechanical ventriloquism of his own, for he was quite sure that his lips
      had been for the moment incapable of speech. Of course he had always known
      that it must come. Inevitable with a girl like Marcia. But hope, though it
      withers, clings hardily to the last pulsing of secret life in the young.
      Even in the heart-emptiness of a long year of silence&mdash;except for the
      one note delivered by Buddy Higman&mdash;Jeremy had cherished a delusion
      dear as on the day when he first met her.... He became aware that Laurens
      was saying something to him. Politics&mdash;that was it. He had to fix his
      mind on politics, and though life had abruptly become sterile of hope and
      dreams, nevertheless there was a job to do. For the next twenty minutes,
      Jeremy passed through an ordeal which entitled him to a hero&rsquo;s medal. He
      forced his aching mind to take in what Laurens was telling him, and
      afterward he fashioned from it a skillful and dispassionate interview.
    </p>
    <p>
      After Laurens&rsquo;s departure the editor opened the drawer in his desk which
      was always kept locked. Therein were a dozen golf scores&mdash;he was
      still very young, and his stock of souvenirs had been pathetically scant&mdash;her
      note and the little photograph. He understood, now, why she had written
      him no letter. When she gave him up, she had mapped out her course for
      herself. If she were not formally betrothed then, she had determined upon
      the step. And having determined, she ended it all, then and there. It was
      the honorable way. It was the direct, definite, frank way. It was the
      right way. It was Marcia&rsquo;s way.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked yearningly at the photograph. Wonderful how that tiny oblong of
      paper, touched with a few flat tints could so evoke the very essence and
      fragrance and challenging sweetness of her! She looked out at him, all
      soft radiance in the hard radiance of the sunlight which flooded her, and
      his fingers, bidden to tear the likeness to fragments and scatter it&mdash;not
      in resentment but as a sacrificial formality&mdash;trembled and slackened.
      What harm, after all, in keeping the picture? It meant nothing&mdash;and
      therein Jeremy Robson lied to his own soul. It meant that he still clung
      to his vision, which nothing had blurred. For no other woman had so much
      as impinged upon the outskirts of his imagination. There was neither time
      nor space for women other than Marcia. He restored the picture, the note,
      the prim numerals of the golf scores&mdash;how vividly he could see the
      full, lithe swing of the young body vivid with untainted health and
      vitality as her brassie flicked the ball cleanly from its turfy lie!&mdash;and
      locked the drawer again. There lay hopes dead and ideals still
      unconquerably alive.

    </p>
    <p>
      Reading the Laurens interview, conspicuously played up, on its merits as
      news, Martin Embree felt rise within him dark misgivings as to his
      supporter. He was of that type which, in its self-centered mind, forbodes
      disloyalty and suspects betrayal in any divergence of opinion or policy
      from its own standards. But his smile was as brilliant as usual, perhaps
      even more so, when he next met Jeremy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty handsome send-off you gave Laurens.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I like him. He&rsquo;s straight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So&rsquo;s a snake&mdash;when it&rsquo;s dead. I told you to look out for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did,&rdquo; said the editor good-humoredly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he fooled me any.
      Or even tried to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s likely to be the man we&rsquo;ve got to fight for the governorship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll fight him, when the time comes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And meantime you boost him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never understand the newspaper game, Martin. That was news;
      therefore worth printing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand this, my boy; that you can&rsquo;t afford to mix up with Laurens
      and his gang.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, cheer up, Martin! I don&rsquo;t intend to. But I can&rsquo;t take your point of
      view in everything, much as I appreciate what you&rsquo;ve done for the paper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, Jeremy had always given ungrudging acknowledgment of Embree&rsquo;s
      services to The Guardian. That first boost in circulation through Embree&rsquo;s
      efforts in the Northern Tier had been invaluable. And now, through his
      strength in local labor circles, Embree was being of assistance to Jeremy,
      in preventing strikes, and allaying trouble in the press-room. The center
      of disturbance there was the white-haired, sharp-tongued Socialist, Nick
      Milliken.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most correct in his attitude toward his employer in work hours, Milliken
      asserted his independence outside the &ldquo;shop&rdquo; by invariably addressing him
      as &ldquo;young feller&rdquo; and usually reproaching him for &ldquo;hanging onto a
      half-mile-post, like Mart Embree,&rdquo; instead of coming out fair and square
      for Socialism and the millennium. As against him Embree played the big,
      stolid German-American foreman Girdner, who had influence among the men,
      and who was a political adherent of the Northern Tier Senator&rsquo;s. On the
      whole the internal affairs of the office were satisfactory. Another
      connection between Embree and The Guardian office was maintained through
      Max Verrall, the Senator&rsquo;s protégé, who, having made good as circulation
      manager, was now handling the paper&rsquo;s advertising, as sub-head of that
      department under the general supervision of Andrew Galpin.
    </p>
    <p>
      For all favors The Guardian repaid Martin Embree by its loyal and
      effectual political support. If the Senator&rsquo;s friends were not always
      acceptable to Jeremy&rsquo;s somewhat squeamish political standards, at least
      his enemies were The Guardian&rsquo;s enemies. No &ldquo;conspiracy of silence&rdquo; on the
      part of the press opposed him now. The Guardian paid so much heed to his
      utterances that The Record was forced to take them up as a matter of news.
      Without this aid, Embree could not have been certain of the nomination for
      Governor at that time. Now it was practically assured to him. The account
      between him and Jeremy Robson stood fairly balanced to date.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy wondered how hard he would take the projected editorial campaign
      against the Germanizing of the public schools.

      CHAPTER VI
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HAT phenomenon of
      finance which has relegated many a business man to a pained and bewildered
      retirement, increase of receipts attended with a parallel deficit, had
      marked The Guardian&rsquo;s first year under the new control. No question but
      that The Guardian was a much livelier, newsier, more influential, and
      better paper. No question but that the public appreciated this. The
      increased and steadily increasing circulation bore proof. With reluctance
      the local advertisers also accepted the fact. Rates had been raised, to
      the accompaniment of loud protests, which were largely formal, for the
      merchants paid the higher charge, and, in many cases, increased their
      advertising appropriation. The Guardian was recognized as a good medium.
      It was on the way to being recognized as a necessary medium. When a
      newspaper reaches that point, its fortune is made.
    </p>
    <p>
      But a newspaper is like an automobile or a loaf of bread in this
      fundamental respect, that it costs more to make a good than a bad one. All
      the special features which Andrew Galpin had put on, mounted up into
      money. The staff was more expensive. The telegraphic service cost more. At
      no time had swelling revenues quite overtaken rising expenditures. Galpin,
      however, who had originally suggested to the new boss A Short Life and a
      Merry One as The Guardian&rsquo;s appropriate motto, was now optimistic. He
      confidently believed the paper to be within measurable distance of assured
      success.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we&rsquo;re pretty near at the end of our rope&mdash;my rope,&rdquo; Jeremy
      pointed out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay-ah. There&rsquo;s other ropes dangling around loose. Why not hitch to one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Borrow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard of its being done in business,&rdquo; replied the general manager
      quizzically. &ldquo;Somebody&rsquo;s got to help the banks make a living.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much do you think we need?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Galpin juggled with a pencil and a sheet of paper. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get enough
      while we&rsquo;re at it. Twenty thousand ought to be the last cent we&rsquo;ll ever
      have to ask for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can we get that much?&rdquo; asked the other doubtfully. &ldquo;On the security of
      the plant? Easy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy&rsquo;s money was in the Fenchester Trust Company, of which Robert Wanser
      was president. No difficulty whatsoever was made by him when Jeremy
      called. Wanser was an anomaly in national sentiment. The grandson of a
      leader of the Young German movement who had found refuge in this country
      from the rigorous repression of Germany in &rsquo;48, the son of a major
      who fought with distinction for the Union through the Civil War, he
      remained impregnably Teutonic in thought, sentiment, and prejudice. He was
      a large, softish man who suggested in his appearance a sleek and benignant
      walrus. He sat back in his chair and listened and puffed and nodded, and
      when the applicant was through, made a notation on a bit of paper. The
      rest was merely a matter of &ldquo;Jeremy Robson&rdquo; at the bottom of a dated form,
      and &ldquo;Do you wish to draw it now or leave it on deposit, Mr. Robson?&rdquo; To
      the borrower it seemed like the nearest thing to magic since his
      great-aunt&rsquo;s bequest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how is the paper getting on, Mr. Robson?&rdquo; asked Wanser benevolently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First-rate. We can feel it taking hold harder and harder every day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; Robert Wanser&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ah&rdquo; had just the faintest touch of a medial &ldquo;c&rdquo; in
      it; just a hint of the guttural, the only relic left in his speech of a
      Teutonicism which three generations had failed to Americanize. &ldquo;That must
      be a great satisfaction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And a great responsibility. What a power for good a newspaper may be,
      even in a small community such as this! Or for evil. Or for evil,&rdquo; he
      repeated sorrowfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It can radiate enlightenment. Or it can scatter poison. The poison of
      class hatred, of political unrest, of racial dissension.&rdquo; He sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Always for the direct method Jeremy asked, &ldquo;You think The Guardian is too
      radical?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A(c)h!&rdquo; said Robert Wanser. &ldquo;I have not assumed to criticize.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m asking for information. That&rsquo;s the only way I can make the paper
      better. By finding out what people think of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A(c)h, yes! There is much to commend in your paper. Much! But it is not
      always quite kindly, is it? Not quite kindly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably not. What have you got in mind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing in particular,&rdquo; disclaimed the banker. &ldquo;I feel that in our
      complicated system there is room for all classes of thought, and that all
      of us who are, in a sense, leaders should set the example of a broad
      tolerance. The imputation of unworthy motives, for example, can do nothing
      but harm. A community such as this should be a brotherhood, all working
      for the common good of the town. Don&rsquo;t you agree with me, Mr. Robson?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To agree with so pious a banality would have been easy; was, in fact,
      almost a requirement of politeness. But Jeremy was wondering what lay
      behind all these words. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It sounds all right. But
      I don&rsquo;t get your real meaning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wanser hastily disclaimed any real meaning, and the interview
      proceeded in a mist of steamy generalities contributed by the banker, of
      which one alone impressed the editor as embodying the kernel of a thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may gain temporary circulation by making enemies, but you lose
      support.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But a newspaper has got to take sides on public questions,&rdquo; protested
      Jeremy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why so? Why should it not be a lens, to collect and focus facts for the
      public&rsquo;s attention?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It should, in the news columns. But editorially?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Comment,&rdquo; said Wanser blandly. &ldquo;Simple, explanatory, enlightening
      comment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t do the business. Take this tax matter&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A(c)h! Very unfortunate! Very unfortunate!&rdquo; murmured the banker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it&rsquo;s unfortunate,&rdquo; returned Jeremy warmly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s unfortunate
      that those best able to pay taxes should get off light at the expense of
      those less able to pay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is not what I meant. These attacks upon property&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re not attacks on property, when property plays fair. Would a simple
      comment have brought old Madam Taylor to time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps. Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy rubbed his nose thoughtfully. &ldquo;Perhaps it would. The facts were
      enough just as they stood.&rdquo; Madam Taylor, the daughter of the dead
      statesman who had founded The Guardian, was not only the richest woman in
      Fenchester, but was also a highly respected and considerably feared local
      institution. Because of that her taxes had not been raised in thirty
      years, though her property had quadrupled in value, until The Guardian
      shocked the community by running afoul of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might have so enraged her that she would have left Fenchester
      forever,&rdquo; accused Wanser.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Small loss, then,&rdquo; returned Jeremy heatedly, he having been the victim of
      the old lady&rsquo;s spiciest line of commentary, after publication of the
      article.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A(c)h! It would be a misfortune to the town,&rdquo; said the banker, thinking,
      on his part, of the heavy balance in the name of Taylor at his bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anyway, Mr. Wanser,&rdquo; said Jeremy, rising to go, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m no neutral. I&rsquo;m for
      or against. And, in reason, The Guardian will be the same. Maybe I&rsquo;m
      wrong. But it&rsquo;s the only way I know. If it makes enemies, I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;
       Indeed it had seemed to the young editor that circulation for The Guardian
      and enmities for its owner were inevitable concomitants in the making.
      Every local question upon which he took sides landed him upon somebody&rsquo;s
      tender toes. Much of the news that he printed&mdash;such as had not been
      printed for fear of hurting some more or less influential person&rsquo;s
      feelings, before The Guardian espoused the policy that news is a commodity
      to which the public is entitled by virtue of its purchase of the paper&mdash;exasperated
      and even alienated the sympathies of the formerly favored elements. But it
      did n&rsquo;t cause them to stop buying the paper, because they shrewdly hoped
      to find equally interesting and annoying items, later, about their
      friends. Then there was the matter of special consideration to the
      advertising patrons; a principle by which the mercantile crowd resolutely
      held, despite Jeremy&rsquo;s pronunciamento at the luncheon. At least three
      fourths of the advertisers in town, Jeremy estimated, were fitfully
      concerned either in getting into The Guardian matters which didn&rsquo;t belong
      there, or in keeping out matters which did; or, if not they, themselves,
      then their wives, children, or intimate associates. With respect to all
      these requests, he cultivated a determined and expensive habit of saying
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo; Thereby, if the paper became newsier and scored a more than
      occasional &ldquo;beat&rdquo; on its rival, The Record, it also became a heavier
      burden to carry, as the wrath of the afflicted gathered stormily about its
      head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though local advertisers resented the policy of the paper, they
      appreciated its value. That is all that kept them in. Verrall, in his
      activities as advertising manager, was constantly reporting evidences of a
      hostile spirit. Half of the big stores in town, he said, would knife The
      Guardian in a minute if they dared. He represented himself as being
      obliged to spend more time in diplomatic soothings than he could well
      spare from the routine of his work, and while advocating the utmost
      freedom of criticism in public matters, as befitted a follower of Embree,
      was mildly deprecatory of what he termed &ldquo;Mr. Robson&rsquo;s hedgehoggishness
      toward advertisers.&rdquo; Malicious tongues, moreover, had been at work among
      the Germans, who formed an important part of the local mercantile world,
      spreading the report that The Guardian was secretly anti-German. If Mr.
      Robson could see his way clear to giving the German-Americans an editorial
      pat on the back occasionally, it would aid Verrall considerably in
      building up his space. Mr. Robson replied that, as it was, he was
      publishing a fair amount of German press-stuff, and he saw no reason to do
      any editorial soft-sawdering for Mr. Bausch and his faction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Foreign advertising, such as the nationally exploited automobiles, soaps,
      razors, breakfast foods, and the like was now coming in in good volume, a
      most encouraging development, for these big advertisers exercise a keen
      discrimination in the matter of newspaper space, and their general support
      not only makes a paper &ldquo;look good&rdquo; to the technical eye, but also gives it
      a certain cachet among lesser concerns. To the high-grade national
      businesses The Guardian had made special appeal by expelling from its
      columns the fake financial, oil, gold, rubber, and real-estate
      dollar-traps, and the quack cure-alls, whose neighborhood in print the
      reputable concerns resent.
    </p>
    <p>
      To offset this, the paper had lost in volume of local advertising. Several
      of the large stores had cut down their space, in token of resentment over
      the raise in rates, and had restored it only gradually and not to the
      full. Barclay &amp; Bull had stayed out for more than six months. But this
      helped more than it hurt The Guardian, for their business showed a marked
      falling-off and their being obliged to come back in, rather shamefacedly,
      was testimony to the paper&rsquo;s value. Turnbull Brothers, of The Emporium,
      the largest of the department stores, had, however, cut off The Guardian
      wholly, in consequence of its reporting a fire in the local freight yard,
      with the detail that a large consignment to The Emporium of the bankrupt
      stock of Putz &amp; Lewin, of Chicago, was included in the losses. As the
      arrival of this consignment was coincident with the announcement of The
      Emporium&rsquo;s annual &ldquo;Grand Clearance Sale,&rdquo; the effect was, as their
      advertising manager passionately stated to Jeremy, &ldquo;derogatory as hell.&rdquo;
       He demanded a retraction. The editor politely regretted that facts were
      both untractable and unretractable matter to deal with. The Turnbulls
      threatened libel. Jeremy told them to go ahead and promised to print daily
      accounts of the proceedings. The Turnbulls resorted to violent names and
      called off their contract for advertising. Jeremy dismissed them with his
      blessing, and told them not to come back until they had learned the
      distinction between advertising and news. Thereupon Verrall bewailed the
      sad fate of the advertising manager of a paper whose chief was an
      irreconcilable stiff-neck, and appealed to Andrew Galpin, but got nothing
      by that step other than unsympathetic advice to confine his troubles to
      his own department lest a worse thing befall him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then there was the case of Aaron Levy, of The Fashion, who, starting on
      the proverbial shoestring, was building up a wide low-class trade, and
      spreading his gospel through the columns of The Guardian, to the extent of
      occasional one-eighth pages. One phase of the Levy trade was a legal but
      unsavory installment business, the details of which were frequently
      threshed out in petty civil court actions. One of these, with a &ldquo;human
      interest&rdquo; end, was reported in The Guardian. Mr. Levy promptly called on
      Jeremy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you want to do? Ruin my business?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that account true?&rdquo; asked Jeremy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neffer mind if it&rsquo;s true. It didn&rsquo;t have to get printed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your business ought to be ruined, from what the Court thinks of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You take my money for advertising it all right,&rdquo; the protestant pointed
      out with justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So we do. We won&rsquo;t any more. The Guardian won&rsquo;t carry your installment
      business, Mr. Levy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;re too good to have my ads in your paper at all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no. We&rsquo;ll be glad to have everything but that one line.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t run my business for me, don&rsquo;t you think it!&rdquo; adjured Mr. Levy
      in one emphatic breath, and departed with a righteous conviction of
      unmerited injury.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Fashion&rsquo;s one-eighth pages no longer graced The Guardian. Too shrewdly
      devoted to his trade to stay out entirely, Mr. Levy confined himself to
      terse announcements in the briefest and cheapest possible space. He also
      helped to spread the evil rumor that young Robson was &ldquo;sore on the
      business men of Fenchester.&rdquo; Business men there were, however, shrewd,
      fair-minded, and far-seeing enough to appreciate The Guardian&rsquo;s
      one-standard policy, even while they deprecated what they regarded as its
      abuse of independence. These formed a strong minority of defenders and
      supporters. Little by little their ranks were increasing. Andrew Galpin&rsquo;s
      optimism, and the debt which represented it, seemed fairly justified as
      the election of the fall of 1913 drew near.
    </p>
    <p>
      Already The Guardian had far outstripped The Record in circulation and in
      advertising revenue. The rival paper was being hard pressed to make a
      respectable showing, and had adopted a decidedly acidulous tone toward
      Jeremy and his publication, letting no opportunity pass to impugn its
      motives and jeer at its principles. Ever ready for a fight, Jeremy was for
      joining issue on the editorial page, but Galpin&rsquo;s wiser counsel withheld
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody cares for newspaper squabbles but newspaper men,&rdquo; said that sage.
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not making a newspaper for newspaper men. We&rsquo;re making a newspaper
      for Bill Smith and Jim Jones and their missises. And we&rsquo;re getting &rsquo;em!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Jeremy Robson was making a newspaper to meet another, more demanding,
      more changeful standard which was yet in a great measure the same. He was
      making a newspaper for Jeremy Robson; for Jeremy Robson, who, with a
      surprised and humble and hungry mind, was being educated by that very
      newspaper which he himself was making. More and more Jeremy Robson, editor
      of The Guardian, was identifying himself in mind and spirit with Bill
      Smith and Jim Jones and their missises, readers and followers of The
      Guardian. Because of that fellowship, because of the implied link of faith
      and trust that had grown up, impalpable, between them, evidenced in
      hundreds of letters to and scores of calls upon &ldquo;the editor,&rdquo; there had
      been established standards to which The Guardian was inviolably if tacitly
      committed. There were things which The Guardian might not do. There were
      things which, when the time came, it might not refrain from doing. An
      implicit faith was pledged. So and not otherwise does a newspaper become
      an institution.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet The Guardian was Jeremy&rsquo;s very own. He felt for it the proprietary
      pride and interest of a man with a growing business and a growing
      influence to wield, and, added to that the affection of a child for a toy
      machine&mdash;which actually goes! He coddled his paper and petted it, and
      treated it, when he could, to new and better equipment, and awoke one day
      to the unpleasant realization that the editorials which he so enjoyed
      writing, and the growing, widening response to which constituted his most
      satisfactory reward, were physically a blotch and a blur and an affront to
      the staggering and baffled eye. The Guardian needed a new dress and needed
      it badly!
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the garmenture of a newspaper is of a costliness to make Paquin,
      Caillot, and their Parisian congeners of the golden needle appear like
      unto ragpickers, when the bills come in. Jeremy bought The Guardian a new
      dress of type. It made a hideous hole, a chasm, an abyss in the loan
      negotiated from the Trust Company. But the paper became a festival to the
      proud eye of its owner. Galpin helped salve his chief&rsquo;s conscience by
      agreeing that they would have had to do it sooner or later anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well advised of the loan, the status of the paper&rsquo;s finances, and the new
      plunge, Montrose Clark and his legal satellite, Judge Dana, held
      consultation. Now, they decided, was the providentially appointed time for
      trying out the transfer ordinance in the City Council. The Guardian, whose
      opposition they had feared, had put itself in a position where it must &ldquo;be
      good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That young cub,&rdquo; said Montrose Clark confidently, &ldquo;will have to come into
      line.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With management. With careful management,&rdquo; amended Judge Dana.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anyway!&rdquo; returned the public utilitarian. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll need every cent he can
      get and when he sees five or six hundred dollars as his share of our
      advertising campaign of education, with more to follow, he&rsquo;ll take his
      orders like the others. I&rsquo;ll send for him in a day or two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, again?&rdquo; said Judge Dana.
    </p>
    <p>
      The puffy jowl of Montrose Clark deepened in color. &ldquo;I shall not tolerate
      any more of his impudence,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;He will come when sent for or&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Mr. Clark, this is a case for diplomacy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For you, you mean, Dana.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you employ me for?&rdquo; soothed the lawyer. &ldquo;Just you have a copy of
      the ordinance drawn up. Tell Garson to get up the advertising figures and
      give them to me. I&rsquo;ll talk to young Mr. Robson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The magnate assented, though with an ill grace. &ldquo;Will you take up the
      matter of your candidacy with him at the same time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Matters were so shaping themselves in politics, that with the figure of
      Martin Embree looming and the probability of a strong radical vote in the
      Legislature, the P.-U. and its allied traction interests in the State
      deemed it advisable to place a safe representative on the Court of Appeals
      bench, where much may be done by &ldquo;interpretation&rdquo; to offset destructive
      legislation. Dana had been selected as the man. In his early days the
      Judge had weathered, with difficulty and not without damage to his
      reputation, two or three legal tempests, one of which had all but caused
      his disbarment. Had not Montrose Clark, already finding him valuable as a
      clever quasher of damage suits in their early stages, employed his
      influence, the Judge would have ceased to ornament the legal profession.
      He had since gone far to rehabilitate himself in the eyes of the public,
      by sticking close to high-class, quiet (not to say secret) corporation
      work. But the better men of his own profession, while recognizing his
      abilities, were still suspicious of him, though not to the point where any
      protest was likely to be made in the face of such powerful interests as
      were backing him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Judge Dana pondered his patron&rsquo;s question. &ldquo;That depends on how he takes
      the transfer plan,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You gave me advice about him,&rdquo; said Montrose Clark rather maliciously;
      &ldquo;to handle him with gloves. You see how it came out. Now I&rsquo;ll give you
      some in return. Put the screws on the young fool!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not my way. And not his description. He&rsquo;s got a lot to learn. I&rsquo;m going
      there as his teacher. I would n&rsquo;t be, if he was a fool.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Channels of communication bring information (and even more misinformation)
      from many sources into an editor&rsquo;s office. Through one of these Jeremy had
      learned of the projected transfer plan&rsquo;s recrudescence. Therefore he was
      prepared when Judge Dana, having called by appointment, stated the case
      flatly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We want your support,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a pretty raw deal, Judge Dana,&rdquo; remarked Jeremy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lawyer&rsquo;s thin and solemn face did not alter its expression of bland
      disinterestedness. &ldquo;Not if looked at in the right light.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the right light?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The P.-U. needs the new arrangement in order to perfect its service to
      the public. The greatest good to the greatest number.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Number One,&rdquo; suggested Jeremy. &ldquo;Mr. Montrose Clark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Setting aside any personal prejudice in the matter, what have you against
      the Public Utilities Corporation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It does n&rsquo;t play fair. It is always begging for special privileges and
      then establishing them as rights after it has got them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lawyer reflected that this theory, presented and amplified editorially
      in The Guardian, would be unpleasantly difficult to refute.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After all, it performs a public service,&rdquo; he pointed out, a bit lamely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The public could do it for itself better and cheaper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s Embreeism. It&rsquo;s Socialism.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call it what you like. It&rsquo;s common sense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me advise you, in the friendliest spirit, not to take up any such
      scatter-brained theories in your paper. They&rsquo;d wreck it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That may come later. I&rsquo;ll tell you this now, Judge. We won&rsquo;t support the
      transfer plan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never thought you would,&rdquo; said the lawyer calmly. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the idea of
      this call, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To suggest that you keep your hands off and let us fight it out in
      Council.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy laughed outright. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t ask me to hold the easy mark while you
      go through his pockets. Only to stand by and not interfere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Judge Dana grinned. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care much for the style of your metaphor,&rdquo; he
      confessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Judge, I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s no go. You can easily bulldoze or bribe the
      Council, if we keep our hands off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fair words, my boy! Fair words! Has n&rsquo;t The Guardian ever done any
      bulldozing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Expect it has&mdash;in a good cause.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a good cause. It&rsquo;s going to be good for you as well as us&mdash;and
      the public.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As how?&rdquo; queried Jeremy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our plan is to present the new system to the public through a series of
      advertisements. Education, you understand. The modern way: through the
      press. Would you like to see the outline?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come to the point. What&rsquo;s the amount?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Where the hand-perfected Garson would have seen hope in the question, the
      warier lawyer scented danger to his plans. Nevertheless he went ahead.
      &ldquo;Five hundred, minimum. Perhaps as high as a thousand, if the public is
      slow to learn. Our total advertising appropriation this year,&rdquo; stated
      Judge Dana with great deliberation, &ldquo;will run to five thousand dollars.
      There is no reason why The Guardian should not get a half of it. At least
      a half.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did Mr. Clark ever get the message that I sent him by Garson, as to
      bribes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bribes?&rdquo; The lawyer looked properly startled. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I doubt it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I sent word to Clark that when I got ready to take bribes, I&rsquo;d take them
      direct, in the form of cash.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not offering to bribe you or The Guardian,&rdquo; protested the other.
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a matter of simple business. We institute an advertising campaign in
      a newspaper. We don&rsquo;t ask it to advocate our measures; to a finicking mind
      that might seem to be a form of bribery. No; we only ask that, having
      published our advertising and accepted us as customers, the paper refrain
      from rendering the service we&rsquo;ve paid for useless or worse than useless,
      by attacking our arguments editorially. Is n&rsquo;t that fair and reasonable?&rdquo;
       pleaded the lawyer, with a plausible gesture of laying the matter out for
      equitable judgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy passed the argument. &ldquo;Do you think Garson ever delivered my
      message?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think it unlikely,&rdquo; returned the other, taken slightly aback.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Afraid?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Politic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The same thing, usually. Are you afraid of Montrose Clark?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lawyer reddened. &ldquo;I came here as one gentleman to another&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With an offer of hush-money,&rdquo; broke in the editor. &ldquo;Come, Judge; you and
      I are down to hard-pan. We can dispense with bluff. However, if you don&rsquo;t
      like the word &lsquo;afraid&rsquo;&mdash;I don&rsquo;t like it much, myself, but that&rsquo;s
      because there are so many things I&rsquo;m trying not to be afraid of&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
      take it back. Now; will you take my message to Clark, as Garson would
      n&rsquo;t?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I will not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll have to write it to him. Or, I might print it in The Guardian,
      in the form of an open letter following this interview.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a confidential visit,&rdquo; cried the lawyer, shocked clean out of his
      professional calm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got me there,&rdquo; admitted the other. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to play square if I
      put up the bluff, have n&rsquo;t I, Judge? Even with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m damned if I understand you, young man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cheer up. We&rsquo;ve got many long years to learn all about each other in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think The Guardian will last?&rdquo; Dana could not resist the temptation
      to impart the dig.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be remembered, if it doesn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; promised its editor. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you
      reconsider the matter of that message, Judge? You can tone it down, you
      know, and temper it to the dignity of the little great man, whereas if I
      write him&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it,&rdquo; declared Dana suddenly. &ldquo;And I won&rsquo;t tone it down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you&rsquo;ll enjoy it,&rdquo; added Jeremy with a grin, which met an unexpected
      response. The two men understood each other. In a certain complementary
      sense they were even sympathetic to each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Devastating was the wrath of Montrose Clark upon receipt of Judge Dana&rsquo;s
      report, wholly unexpurgated. He fumed, first redly, then purply, as if
      some strange chemical reaction were taking place inside him; and from the
      exhalations of that turmoil, there crystallized a most unwise decision.
      Montrose Clark decided upon reprisals with his enemy&rsquo;s own weapon. He had
      Garson write several personal attacks upon Jeremy Robson, and intimidated
      Farley into publishing them in The Record, at special advertising rates, a
      procedure decidedly painful to Farley&rsquo;s views of professional ethics and
      journalistic fellowship. Jeremy retorted with a series of hasty but rather
      brilliant imaginary interviews with one &ldquo;President Puff,&rdquo; which all but
      drove the subject of them into an apoplexy, and were a source of joy to
      the ungodly, albeit discreetly subdued as to expression, for the P.-U.
      head was a man of power in many directions. At this point the Church
      rushed into the breach in the person of the Reverend Mr. Merserole,
      Montrose Clark&rsquo;s rector, and the benefidary of a five thousand dollar gift
      to the fund of the Nicklin Avenue Church only a week previous. Both the
      high-minded Mr. Clark and the high-church rector would have been
      profoundly and quite honestly shocked at the suggestion that there was the
      faintest element of financial influence (in impious circles called
      &ldquo;graft&rdquo;) in what followed. But the reverend gentleman preached an able and
      severe sermon upon the topic &ldquo;Poisoned Pens,&rdquo; in which a certain type of
      reckless, demagogic, passion-inciting, self-seeking, conscienceless
      journalism was lifted up to public reprobation in a pillar of fiery
      invective. The Guardian violated all precedent by publishing the livelier
      portions of the sermon under the caption, &ldquo;Whom can the Reverend Gentleman
      Mean?&rdquo; and followed this up with a report on the Clark contribution,
      paralleled with further excerpts from the more spiritual and lofty
      portions of the sermon, headed with the text, &ldquo;Where your treasure is,
      there will your heart be also.&rdquo; The Reverend Mr. Merserole was pained and
      annoyed for the remainder of the week by a steady influx of marked copies
      of The Guardian. He was stimulated to a holy but helpless wrath by the
      subsequent discovery that he, the impeccable pastor of the fashionable
      Nicklin Avenue Church, had been impiously dubbed &ldquo;the Nickle-in-the-Slot
      rector.&rdquo; This ribaldry he ascribed to Jeremy Robson&rsquo;s unprofessional wit,
      wherein he was wrong. As a matter of fact, it was a flash from the quaint
      mind of Eli Wade, the Boot &amp; Shoe Surgeon. But Jeremy had earned
      another implacable enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Guardian did not get its share of the $500-or-more educational
      advertising from the P.-U. Indeed, there was no educational advertising.
      The transfer issue was passed, for the time, rather than venture into the
      open where, as Judge Dana observed, &ldquo;The Guardian was waiting for it with
      a fish-horn and a brick&rdquo;; and the P.-U.&lsquo;s legal lights set about drafting
      a blanket franchise for the consideration of some future legislature,
      which should enable the corporation to do about what it pleased without
      reference to dubious councils or pestilent journalistic demagogues.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">C</span>RYSTALLIZING
      politics left but two figures in the field for the campaign of 1913. That
      Martin Embree would carry the radical banner was a foregone conclusion.
      Magnus Laurens was logically the man to oppose him. To the
      Clark-Wanser-Dana wing of the party, who owned the then Governor, a
      weak-kneed, feeble-spirited, oratorical creature, Laurens was distasteful.
      He was far more prone to give orders than to take them. But on fundamental
      issues he was &ldquo;right&rdquo;; a sound conservative, reliably hostile to all the
      quasi-socialistic theories threatening the control of the State. Moreover
      his personal and political rectitude was beyond suspicion. Like or dislike
      him, he was the only man in sight with a chance of beating Embree.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime &ldquo;Deutschtum,&rdquo; that world-wide, subterranean propaganda of German
      influence, German culture, German hopes and ambitions and future
      dominations which had for a quarter of a century established itself
      reproductively as the ichneumon parasite affixes its eggs to the body of
      the helpless host which, later, their brood will prey upon and destroy&mdash;Deutschtum
      was scheming out the peaceable and subtle conquest of Centralia through
      capture of the minds of the coming generations of citizens. The Cultural
      Language Bill was quite harmless in appearance, so astutely had it been
      drawn. Under pretense of giving parents of public school pupils the right
      to secure for their children, by petition, instruction in foreign
      languages, it actually established German as a &ldquo;preferred study&rdquo; with the
      heaviest ratio of credits, and, in the advanced schools, as practically a
      compulsory subject. This meant the addition of some four to five hundred
      teachers of German throughout the State, every one of whom would be a
      propagandist of Deutschtum. As a side issue, the determination of the
      textbooks on European history was left to the German staff. The school
      boards of the State being already pretty well Teutonized, it was evident
      that, should the bill pass, history as taught in the Centralia school
      system would be censored agreeably to the purposes of His Imperial Majesty
      Wilhelm of Germany.
    </p>
    <p>
      Originally it was intended to present the measure, backed by a formidable
      list of names from the academic world, with a sprinkling of &ldquo;prominent
      citizens,&rdquo; and push it quietly through as a purely educational and
      technical matter into which, the professionals and professors having said
      their say in advocacy, the public need not trouble itself to examine.
      Leave these esoteric matters to the specialists! The list of endorsers was
      prepared. It was comprehensive, as regards the colleges and schools, the
      pedagogic element being influenced by the natural academic sympathy for
      the German educational system which honors scholarship so highly.
      Prominent citizens lent their names as prominent citizens always will when
      a petition not affecting their own pockets (though it may affect the
      national integrity of their country) is presented. A committee, graced by
      the presence of Emil Bausch, Professor Brender, head of the German
      Department of the local university, Professor Rappelje, of the Economics
      Department, Judge Dana, the Reverend Mr. Merserole, Farley of The Record,
      and others, with Robert Wanser as chairman, made a formal appearance as
      sponsors. It was a solemn, dull, and impressive occasion, and The Guardian
      representative sent to report it almost yawned his head off. He sadly
      envied his boss whom he had met coming out of the office juggling two
      white and gleaming golf-balls. He wished he owned a paper and could devote
      a morning to pure sport whenever so minded!
    </p>
    <p>
      The golf-balls did not indicate unmingled recreation for the boss of The
      Guardian. He was responding to a telephone challenge for a match with
      Magnus Laurens. Since the agreement in the editor&rsquo;s den, the water-power
      magnate had made rather a habit of dropping in upon Jeremy when he came to
      Fenchester. He would stretch his powerful figure in Jeremy&rsquo;s easy-chair,
      open the friendly hostilities by proposing to him that, since he believed
      in other people&rsquo;s property being taken over for the public good, he should
      deliver The Guardian to Nick Milliken and the real Socialists; shrewdly
      discuss politics and the practitioners thereof; and invariably wind up on
      the main interest which the two men held in common, the Americanization of
      their hybrid State.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even at its best, Laurens&rsquo;s golf-game was not redoubtable to a player of
      Jeremy&rsquo;s caliber. On this particular morning it was far from its best.
      Turning to his opponent after a flagrant flub on the ninth green, the
      older man said: &ldquo;My mind isn&rsquo;t on the game to-day. Let&rsquo;s get an early
      lunch, and talk.&rdquo; As soon as they were seated at the table, he opened up
      the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re against me, of course, in the campaign.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. We&rsquo;re for Embree.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right. What I&rsquo;m going to say does n&rsquo;t contemplate any
      possibility of your changing. Have you read the Cultural Language Bill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I&rsquo;ve sent a man up to cover the hearing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did n&rsquo;t you read it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understood it was n&rsquo;t of any special importance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From whom? Embree? Never mind,&rdquo; added Laurens, smiling. &ldquo;You need n&rsquo;t
      answer. Remember our conversation about Deutschtum in the schools?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As this bill was explained to me, it is n&rsquo;t at all the measure you
      described in outline.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not on the surface. They&rsquo;ve changed it. But it&rsquo;s even worse in intent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve made a study of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They asked me to sign it. I refused.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who asked you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In confidence, Robert Wanser.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, he was one of the leaders in the movement for your nomination.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As he took pains to remind me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this likely to be made a political issue?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so. Not in the party sense. The German crowd want to push
      the bill through as quietly as possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s natural. Once they get their system fastened on the schools&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s there to stay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;ll get back to the office, Mr. Laurens. I want to get in touch
      with our reporter at the hearing.&rdquo; Olin, the reporter in question,
      abruptly ceased yawning his head off upon receipt of instructions to
      follow closely the representations made for the bill. His story, edited by
      Jeremy himself with illuminating side touches, turned that
      innocent-seeming measure inside out and revealed some interesting
      phenomena on the inner side. One remark of Magnus Laurens&mdash;&ldquo;I got my
      first schooling in the Corner School-House and I want to see it stay as
      American as it was in my day&rdquo;&mdash;stuck in Jeremy&rsquo;s mind. Out of it he
      constructed an editorial on the Corner School-House as the keystone of
      Americanism, never for an instant foreboding that the phrase would become
      the catchword of a bitter campaign. The first effect of the editorial was
      to bring Embree around to the Club at dinner-time to find Jeremy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What on earth did you make that break for?&rdquo; cried the harassed statesman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Break? It wasn&rsquo;t a break. That bill means more than you think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It means nothing serious. Or it would n&rsquo;t have, if you had n&rsquo;t made an
      issue of it. Now, the Lord knows what we&rsquo;re in for!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An open discussion is my guess. That was the object of the editorial.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;ll get that! If that were all&mdash;or half!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have n&rsquo;t killed the bill, have we?&rdquo; asked the editor hopefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. But it will have to be cut and pruned a good deal, to meet
      arguments.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will that hurt your feelings?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I care nothing about the bill. It&rsquo;s only a sop to the harmless vanity of
      the Germans. But you&rsquo;ve got them down on you again. And they blame me for
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Do</i> they! Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Senator laughed in a half-embarrassed way. &ldquo;Well, you know, Jem, I&rsquo;m
      credited with having some influence with The Guardian. I wish I had half
      I&rsquo;m credited with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean that you &lsquo;re supposed to control the paper&rsquo;s policies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get disturbed over it. I can&rsquo;t help it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor can I, apparently,&rdquo; returned the editor, frowning. &ldquo;People absolutely
      refuse to believe that a man is responsible for his own paper&mdash;except
      when there&rsquo;s something to kick on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you going to do now about the bill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let it simmer. Take another shot at it when it comes up again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you want to lose me the election?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come out on the other side if you want to, Martin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am for the bill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make a speech and say so, then. We&rsquo;ll report you in full, and give you a
      leading editorial courteously regretting that so brilliant and far-seeing
      and sturdily American a statesman should be in error on this one point.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An answering smile came into Martin Embree&rsquo;s expressive face. &ldquo;Go a little
      light on the sturdy American feature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you are that, are n&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I am. Just on this bill, though, I don&rsquo;t care to ram it down
      the Germans&rsquo; throats.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never teach me politics, Mart,&rdquo; sighed the other. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m too
      single-barreled and one-ideaed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One-eyed, my boy, one-eyed. Try to see the thing from the other fellow&rsquo;s
      point of view.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your point of view at present is that I &lsquo;ve gone astray from your good
      influence. Is that it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are other influences, Jem.&rdquo; The Senator&rsquo;s smile was broad and
      golden as a bar of sunlight. &ldquo;I hear you were out at the swell Country
      Club this morning with Magnus Laurens.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your information is O.K.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he talk to you about this bill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he against it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is. Refused to sign the memorial.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Embree&rsquo;s face grew heavy and thoughtful. &ldquo;Did he so! I wonder if we could
      get him on record?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Magnus Laurens is n&rsquo;t likely to dodge an issue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a queer associate for the editor of The Guardian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I pick my own associates,&rdquo; retorted Jeremy shortly. &ldquo;Or let them pick
      you. Until they get ready to drop you again. That&rsquo;s the way with those
      fellows that have got too much money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t likely to buy me away, Martin,&rdquo; replied Jeremy, recovering his
      temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not worrying.&rdquo; The Embree smile was on duty again. &ldquo;What bothers me
      is what the Germans will do to you for to-day&rsquo;s paper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What the Germans did to Jeremy Robson was, in the terse slang of the day,
      a plenty. The German press, religious and lay, attacked The Guardian as an
      exponent of a narrow and blighting Know-Nothingism. One or two small
      German organizations passed high-sounding resolutions of reprehension.
      There was a flood of letters and enough &ldquo;stop-the-paper&rdquo; orders to afflict
      the soul of the much-tried Verrall. The most definite response came from
      Bernard Stockmuller, the jeweler, a generous advertising patron of The
      Guardian. On the morning following the hearing on the bill he met Jeremy
      on the street and stopped him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vot you got against the Chermans, Mr. Robson?&rdquo; he demanded truculently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a thing in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Emil Bausch told alretty how you turned down Prinds Henry&rsquo;s ledder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He says you are a Cherman-hater. If you are a Cher-man-hater,&rdquo; continued
      the irate jeweler, overriding the other&rsquo;s protest, &ldquo;I guess a Cherman&rsquo;s
      money ain&rsquo;t good enough for you. My advertising you don&rsquo;d get any more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need it on those terms,&rdquo; replied the owner of The Guardian. &ldquo;And
      you may tell Mr. Bausch from me that he lies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No other advertiser actually deserted the paper, though Verrall reported
      much ill-feeling among the German mercantile element. The sturdy jeweler
      alone was enough a man of principle to make his nationalism superior to
      his business.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it worth while?&rdquo; was the argument posed by Embree, a fortnight later
      when the bill, in re-amended form, was coming up again, and Jeremy was
      whetting his pen for another tilt at it. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve done the job. Can&rsquo;t you
      drop it now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have we done the job, though?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely. Look at the bill now. Practically everything you objected to is
      out. I&rsquo;ll guarantee it harmless, myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What he said was in a sense true. Practically every point made in The
      Guardian had been speciously met in the new draft of the bill. But, in
      essence, it remained the same, an instrument of Deutschtum. Jeremy did not
      look at the amended measure more than to give it a hasty glance. He
      accepted it on the Honorable Martin Embree&rsquo;s word; and as he did so he was
      conscious deep within himself that he was dodging responsibility; that he
      really did not want to know too much about the new form. The Stockmuller
      incident had disturbed him, for he liked the little, impetuous jeweler.
      Then, too, the accusation that he could endure with the least equanimity
      was that of narrow-mindedness. Men whose sound Americanism was as
      trustworthy as their technical judgment had endorsed the measure. The
      Guardian went off guard. The bill became a law.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unforeseen concomitants marked its political course. Embree, playing
      expert politics, so arranged matters that Magnus Laurens was challenged
      repeatedly on the &ldquo;Corner School-House&rdquo; issue. It did not lie within
      Laurens&rsquo;s vigorous and frank nature to refrain from declaring any
      principle which he held. He replied in speeches which, slightly and
      cleverly distorted by the trained German-language press, gave profound and
      bitter offense to the German-Americans, even the best of them. Taking up
      the controversy at the politically effective moment, Embree pushed it,
      making the most of his adversary&rsquo;s alleged prejudice and narrowness,
      particularly in the foreign-born districts. Long before the election it
      was evident that the school-house slogan alone would beat Laurens. He was
      heavily defeated. That morning&rsquo;s golf with Jeremy did it.
    </p>
    <p>
      In honor, The Guardian had refrained from making use of the &ldquo;Corner
      School-House&rdquo; issue against Laurens. Jeremy at least would not play the
      turncoat. He persuaded himself that, in resisting Embree&rsquo;s arguments for a
      strategic change of base, he was doing all that could be required of him.
      Nevertheless, it was with an inner qualm that he met Magnus Laurens, a
      week after the election, their first interview since the golf-game.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Mr. Laurens,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you made a good fight. We can&rsquo;t all win.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But some of us can stand by our colors even if we lose,&rdquo; said the
      downright Laurens, and passed on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t stand defeat,&rdquo; said Jeremy to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the explanation did not satisfy his inner self. Deep down he was
      conscious of his first surrender.

      CHAPTER VIII
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>IX weeks after
      Martin Embree&rsquo;s triumphant election to the governorship, the owner of The
      Guardian visited the Fenchester Trust Company for the formality of
      renewing his note. He was referred to President Robert Wanser. More
      walrus-like than ever, the president of the institution looked this
      morning as if he might have eaten a fish that did n&rsquo;t quite agree with
      him. Jeremy stated his errand. Mr. Wanser ruminated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Difficulties have arisen,&rdquo; he presently announced. &ldquo;What difficulties?&rdquo;
       asked Jeremy, startled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Trust Company does not see its way to renewing your note at this
      time, Mr. Robson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not said that anything is wrong. It is merely a matter of business
      policy. The loan is a heavy one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is well secured.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not question that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The paper has turned the corner. We are making money to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-day&mdash;you are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And we shall make more from now on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A(c)h!&rdquo; observed the banker with his buried guttural. &ldquo;That is prophecy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Based on facts and figures. I can show them to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No need.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy reflected, with an unpleasant sensation of being spied upon, that
      probably the local banks knew as much of the financial side of his
      business as he himself did; perhaps more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you consider The Guardian weaker security than it was?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not said so,&rdquo; replied the impassive walrus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have n&rsquo;t said anything. Do you intend to, or am I wasting my time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy arose, looking at the financier with a lively eye. This was not at
      all what Wanser desired. He intended to read this young sprig of
      journalism an impressive and costly lesson, after first reducing him to a
      condition of affliction suitable for the punitive exercise. It annoyed him
      to find that Jeremy did not reduce; on the contrary, that he was likely to
      escape uninstructed in that discipline to which he, Wanser, was leading by
      gradual stages. Forced to a shorter cut he said oracularly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A newspaper&rsquo;s best asset is its friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The editor&rsquo;s regard continued intent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Its heaviest liability is enemies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still no response from the beneficiary of these pearls of wisdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A newspaper is on the down-grade when it makes unfair and prejudiced
      attacks upon&mdash;upon any class of people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Talk plain, Mr. Wanser. You mean the Germans.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The walrus, startled by this abruptness, began to bark. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I
      mean. That&rsquo;s exactly what I mean. You&rsquo;ve got a grudge against the
      Germans.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have. It proves itself. The Germans are the best citizens in the
      State.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy laughed not quite pleasantly. &ldquo;I was betting myself you&rsquo;d say that
      next.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say what? I don&rsquo;t understand you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every German-American I&rsquo;ve ever talked with tells me sooner or later that
      the German-Americans are the solidest or the best or the most
      representative citizens in the country. If not the most modest,&rdquo; added he
      maliciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like most retorts inspired by annoyance it was a tactless speech. The
      walrus bristled. &ldquo;You see!&rdquo; he growled. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s your prejudice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No prejudice at all. The Germans considered as people are all very well.
      I like them and respect them. But there are other people in America, you
      know,&mdash;Americans, for instance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We all know how you feel. We all know why you fought our school bill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did n&rsquo;t fight it. I let up on it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You let up when you were afraid to go on,&rdquo; taunted the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy&rsquo;s face flamed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a&mdash;&rdquo; he began, and stopped short,
      swallowing hard. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; he said with quiet bitterness. &ldquo;I was a
      quitter. It serves me right that you should be the second man to tell me
      so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You quit too late.&rdquo; The walrus was enjoying himself now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Evidently. All right, Mr. Wanser. The note will be paid when due. At
      least I&rsquo;m glad we understand each other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The walrus, briefly meditant upon this, did n&rsquo;t like it. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be so sure
      you understand it all,&rdquo; was his parting word, by which he really meant
      that he failed to understand Jeremy. There was a large leaven of timidity
      in his imposing bulk.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Andrew Galpin the interview as detailed by his boss proved no great
      surprise. &ldquo;Dutch Bob&rdquo;&mdash;thus he irreverently dubbed Fenchester&rsquo;s
      leading banker&mdash;&ldquo;is sore on two counts. You mussed up his bill.
      That&rsquo;s the first and worst. The other is our support of Mart Embree.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Embree and Wanser worked for the bill together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay-ah. That&rsquo;s all right. Wanser is all for Embree when he&rsquo;s a German
      booster. He&rsquo;s all against him when he&rsquo;s a radical. It&rsquo;s one of the twists
      of politics.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why are they so hot about this school business anyway? It almost makes me
      believe that Wymett and Laurens are right in their Deutschtum theory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you go seeing ghosts, Boss,&rdquo; advised the general manager,
      good-humoredly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you don&rsquo;t take any stock in the notion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About the Germans? Oh, I don&rsquo;t know. Let &rsquo;em play with their
      little Dutch toys. I guess we&rsquo;re a big enough country to absorb all the
      sauerkraut and Wienerwursts they can put into our system. What&rsquo;s the use
      of being cranky about it? It only gets the paper in wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re certainly in wrong with Wanser. And now we&rsquo;re out. Got twenty
      thousand dollars up your sleeve, Andy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I&rsquo;ve spent my week&rsquo;s salary,&rdquo; answered the other with a grin. &ldquo;The
      Drovers&rsquo; Bank would be my best guess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To the Drovers&rsquo; Bank went the owner of the Fenches-ter Guardian, a daily
      with a rapidly rising circulation of eleven thousand, an increasing
      advertising patronage, and a fair plant. He was courteously received by
      the president of the institution, an old, glossy, and important looking
      nonentity named Warrington. Mr. Warrington listened with close attention,
      made some thoughtful figures on a blotter, and requested Mr. Robson to
      return that afternoon when a positive answer would be given. But Mr.
      Warrington thought&mdash;he was quite of the opinion&mdash;he confidently
      believed&mdash;that there would be no difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s one thing that worries me, Boss,&rdquo; commented Andrew Galpin as the
      pair sat absorbing coffee and pie into their systems at a five-cent,
      time-saving lunch-counter near the office.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pass me the sugar&mdash;and the worry,&rdquo; requested Jeremy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should Wanser close down just at this time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, safely secured loans of twenty thousand dollars aren&rsquo;t the kind of
      business a bank chucks to another bank.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did n&rsquo;t I indicate to you that his loyal German heart was sore?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why was n&rsquo;t it sore last summer, when the bill was up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think somebody&rsquo;s been stirring him up to go after us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More likely he&rsquo;s got some reason to think we&rsquo;re up against it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hoots! We were never in such good shape.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s our view. I&rsquo;m wondering if, maybe, Bausch and his lot are putting
      up some kind of a game.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What kind of a game can they be putting up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d have to understand German to read their minds. Maybe they&rsquo;ll stir up
      the advertisers against us. Like Stockmuller.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any local advertiser that thinks he can do business without The
      Guardian,&rdquo; stated the owner arrogantly, &ldquo;is suffering from an aggravated
      form of fool-in-the-head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s good doctrine. If only you can make &rsquo;em believe it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They believe it all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, Boss. Why not get Mart Embree&rsquo;s view on it?&rdquo;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good idea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy went to the Governor-elect. &ldquo;What did you expect?&rdquo; asked that acute
      commentator on men and events. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you understand that you insulted
      every good German-American by attacking them on the point where their
      pride is most involved, the superiority of their educational system?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Allowing that, is this just a belated revenge on Wanser&rsquo;s part?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. It&rsquo;s business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To drop $1400 a year interest on a good note?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would have cost the Trust Company more than that to carry you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t get the point, Martin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Deutscher Club account. Emil Bausch&rsquo;s account. Henry Vogt. Arndt &amp;
      Niebuhr. Stockmuller&mdash;Have I said enough?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They would have withdrawn? Are they as sore as that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of these days you&rsquo;ll realize the truth of what I told you about
      committing hara-kiri, Jem. There&rsquo;s only one safe way with the Germans. Let
      them alone and they&rsquo;ll let you alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Will they! That shows how one-sidedly you look at it. They&rsquo;ve begun
      flooding the office already with their press-work for the winter Singing
      Society festival.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly harmless. You certainly can&rsquo;t see anything objectionable in
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; admitted Jeremy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Run a lot of it, then. It costs nothing, and it will help square you for
      the school bill break.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Which Jeremy found good advice and resolved to follow. He said as much and
      was approved as one coming to his senses after regrettable errancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much pull do you think the Deutscher Club crowd have with the
      Drovers&rsquo; Bank?&rdquo; asked Jeremy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so much. If you do have difficulty there, let me know. I could
      probably fix you up in some of the out-of-town banks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Drovers&rsquo; Bank made no difficulty. Mr. Warrington was most amenable
      when Jeremy returned. This helped to reassure the borrower that no
      financial plot threatened his newspaper. He would have felt less happy had
      he known that the interval between his visits had been utilized by Mr.
      Warrington to pay a call of consultation upon a certain florid and
      self-important gentleman, no lover of The Guardian or its editor since he
      had suffered indignities of print as &ldquo;President Puff&rdquo; from Jeremy&rsquo;s
      satiric and not always well-advised pen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him have it,&rdquo; directed the public utilitarian. &ldquo;Three months&rsquo; note.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montrose Clark smiled puffily upon Judge Selden Dana later at the club.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought he would come around to us,&rdquo; he stated. &ldquo;What will you do now?&rdquo;
       asked the lawyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; replied the magnate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Which might have been regarded either as direction, threat, or declaration
      of intent, and partook of the nature of all three.
    </p>

      CHAPTER IX
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">B</span>UDDY HIGMAN,
      prosperous in a new blue-and-yellow mackinaw (Christmas), a pair of fur
      mittens (New Year&rsquo;s), and high snow-boots (accumulated savings), entered
      the Fenchester Post-Office with the mien of one having important business
      with the Government. Four dollars a week was now Buddy&rsquo;s princely stipend
      from The Guardian, for working before and after school hours at a special
      job of clipping and sorting advertisements from the press of the State,
      for purposes of comparison.
    </p>
    <p>
      Occasionally Buddy brought in an item of news, with all the pride of a
      puppy bringing in a mouse, and beat it out with two fingers on a borrowed
      typewriter. Such of these contributions as got into print were paid for
      extra. Thereby Buddy was laboriously building up a bank account. It was
      young Mr. Higman&rsquo;s intention to be, one day, Governor of the State. But in
      his wilder and more untrammeled flights, he hoped to be an editor like Mr.
      Robson. Buddy was an enthusiastic, even a hiero-phantic worker at his job.
      He was worth all that The Guardian paid him. Even had he not been, the
      Boss would have kept him on. For he was, all unknowing, a link; decidedly
      a tenuous link, but the only permanent and reliable one, between Jeremy
      and a foregone past.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the stamp window Mr. Burton Higman, dealing with the United States
      Government, produced a silver dollar and gave his order in a firm and
      manly voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hullo, Buddy,&rdquo; greeted the clerk. &ldquo;Still got that girl in Yurrup, I see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A fire sprang and spread in Mr. Higman&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;And the rest in
      postal-cards,&rdquo; he directed with dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re our best little customer,&rdquo; continued the flippant clerk. (The
      little customer murderously contemplated arranging with The Guardian,
      later, to write an editorial about him and get him fired!) &ldquo;Write to her
      every day, don&rsquo;t che?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shuttup, y&rsquo; ole fool!&rdquo; retorted the infuriate youth, stepping aside to
      reckon up his purchase, lest it might be short.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yessir,&rdquo; continued the blatant gossip, to the next comer. &ldquo;He sure is the
      ready letter-writer, only <i>an&rsquo;&rsquo;</i> original. Don&rsquo;t see how he has time
      to help you edit your paper, Mr. Robson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Robson! The shock diverted Buddy at the twenty-eighth count. He looked
      up into the friendly face of the Boss.
    </p>
    <p>
      He hastened to defend himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I yain&rsquo;t, either, Mr. Robson. &rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t letters at all. They&rsquo;re fer
      noospapers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are they?&rdquo; said his chief, walking out into the wintry air with him. &ldquo;I
      did n&rsquo;t know we had so much foreign circulation, Buddy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir; we ain&rsquo;t. Say, Boss,&rdquo; he added after a pause, &ldquo;we gained five
      new ads on The Record this week, an&rsquo; they only got one that we did n&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good business, Buddy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An&rsquo; I had two sticks in the paper yesterday. Dje see it? Story of the kid
      that fell through the ice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be a reporter one of these days, son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, gee!&rdquo; said Buddy ecstatically. Then, with resentment, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the
      good of school, anyway?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re going to be a real newspaper man you&rsquo;ll need all the education
      you can get.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo; The aspiring neophyte sighed. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what She says.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was but one &ldquo;She&rdquo; in the vocabulary of the exclusive and worshiping
      Buddy. Her name was never pronounced in the conversations on the subject
      between himself and his Boss. There was no need of being more specific,
      for either of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s good advice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Buddy marched along beside his employer, obviously wriggling upon the hook
      of some pointed thought. Presently further reticence became impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Robson!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Them stamps&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would the blue pencil do to a sentence beginning that way, Buddy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Those</i> stamps&mdash;it&rsquo;s like I told the fresh guy at the window.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re for the circulation department?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir. But they&rsquo;re for circulation all right. I been sendin&rsquo; the paper
      every day to Hamburg.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy&rsquo;s pulses quickened. &ldquo;Your own idea, Buddy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nope. I&rsquo;m sendin&rsquo; it to Her. It &rsquo;s Her idear. She reads it
      reg&rsquo;lar. She&rsquo;s deeply int&rsquo;rusted in my cay-reer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did you get that? It doesn&rsquo;t sound like Her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t. Got it out of a book,&rdquo; confessed the boy. &ldquo;I write to Her,
      too,&rdquo; he added happily. &ldquo;She ast me to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does she think of your work?&rdquo; inquired the Boss gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t heard from Her since I began gettin&rsquo; my stuff in the paper. But I
      guess She likes the paper all right. She tells me in most every letter
      what a big thing it is to help make a noospaper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does She? What else does She say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dunno.&rdquo; The boy lost himself in thought. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a little here an&rsquo; a
      little there. She never says much; not any one time. But you can see She
      thinks a lot of the Business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, you would n&rsquo;t suppose that, would you?&rdquo; said the artful Jeremy,
      feeding his hunger for the mere, dear memory of her brought back and made
      real by speech. &ldquo;It must be because you told her you were going to be a
      newspaper man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it. She thinks it&rsquo;s like being a preacher, only more so. She says
      you must n&rsquo;t ever be mean or give away a friend or take advantage of
      having a noospaper to write for. An&rsquo; She says you got to always write what
      you honest-to-God think, because it&rsquo;s yella to do the other thing. I guess
      She would n&rsquo;t stand for a fake, not for a second! I bet She&rsquo;d take the
      hide off&rsquo;n some o&rsquo; them&mdash;o&rsquo; those Record guys. An&rsquo; She says the
      hardest thing &rsquo;ll be some time when there&rsquo;s somethin&rsquo; a fella
      oughta write an&rsquo; that &rsquo;ll get him in wrong if he does write it, for
      him not to lay down an&rsquo; quit on it. An&rsquo; She says never, never to be afraid
      o&rsquo; your job, because that makes the job your boss an&rsquo; not you the job&rsquo;s
      boss. An&rsquo; She says unless a guy can&rsquo;t trust himself nobuddy can trust him
      an&rsquo; be safe, no matter how much they want to. I guess that&rsquo;s about all
      right! Ain&rsquo;t it, Boss?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about all right, Buddy,&rdquo; said Jeremy with an effort. That final bit
      of philosophy had stabbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the presses had stopped and the offices had emptied, that evening,
      the editor of The Guardian sat at his desk with the little photograph of
      Marcia Ames before him. He looked into the frank and radiant face; into
      the eyes that met the world and its perplexities so steadily, with so pure
      and single-minded a challenge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did n&rsquo;t ask much, did you, my dear!&rdquo; he said softly to the picture.
      &ldquo;You only asked that I should be straight and honest; not a shifter and a
      coward. Well, it was too much. Buddy may do better. I&rsquo;ll help him as far
      as I can. That&rsquo;s a promise, my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He heard the departing Buddy whistling outside. His footsteps approached
      the door. Jeremy slipped a hand over the picture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anythin&rsquo; more you want me for, Boss?&rdquo; asked the boy, appearing in the
      doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Buddy. Good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Night.&rdquo; He paused. &ldquo;I dunno&rsquo;s She would have wanted me to tell you about
      the paper,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;She never told me not to, though. I kinda thought
      you&rsquo;d wanta know. I guess we got a man-size job makin&rsquo; a paper good enough
      for Her to read, ain&rsquo;t we, Boss!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess we have,&rdquo; said Jeremy steadily.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door shut and he returned to his contemplation of the picture. &ldquo;You
      read me, my dear,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You were reading me all the time. You read me
      in the Eli Wade story. And in the golf story. And perhaps in others I did
      n&rsquo;t realize. You knew I&rsquo;d come eventually to do just such a wretched crawl
      as I did on the German school bill. You knew that you never could trust
      yourself to me. You&rsquo;d seen me go back on myself. You knew that a man who
      would go back on himself would go back on you when the test came.&rdquo; He
      mused bitterly. &ldquo;As I would have done,&rdquo; said Jeremy Robson.
    </p>
    <p>
      No man ever pronounced upon himself a harsher judgment.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">B</span>OSS,&rdquo; said Andrew
      Galpin.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had come in and perched himself upon a corner of Jeremy&rsquo;s desk,
      swinging his long legs. A folded copy of that day&rsquo;s Guardian served him
      for a fan, which he plied languidly, for it was the early hot spell of
      June, 1914. The regard with which he favored his chief was both
      affectionate and quizzical.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; queried Jeremy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D&rsquo; you know we&rsquo;re pretty near two years old?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Andy. We are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D&rsquo; you feel it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and a couple of hundred years on top of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So bad as that! We&rsquo;re some old for our age, I&rsquo;ll admit. But I don&rsquo;t see
      any signs of senile decay, yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, we can still stir our bones enough to get off the press on time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think of this feller&rsquo;s paper, anyway, Boss?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do <i>you?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty well satisfied, thank you. We&rsquo;ve got fourteen thousand circulation
      that you could n&rsquo;t pry loose with a crow-bar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could n&rsquo;t we? I&rsquo;m not going to try.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not going to? You <i>have</i> tried. You&rsquo;ve stepped on every cussed one
      of their cussed toes, one time or another. Dam&rsquo; fi don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ve got
      &rsquo;em so they <i>like</i> it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Queer way they&rsquo;ve got of showing it, then. Do you ever read the editorial
      correspondence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all right!&rdquo; The general manager waved such matters loftily
      away. &ldquo;They quit the paper, sore. Then they get over it and come back. If
      they don&rsquo;t, there&rsquo;s plenty of others to take their places. Even the
      Dutchers&rdquo;&mdash;this being, at the time, Mr. Galpin&rsquo;s term indicative of
      that powerful and flourishing organization, the Deutscher Club&mdash;&ldquo;have
      come around.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not all of them. Stockmuller is out still.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a stiff-neck. He&rsquo;s the only one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not the only advertiser. The Laundry Association have never got over Wong
      Kee, the yellow peril. The Emporium takes as little space as possible. And
      I don&rsquo;t notice the P.-U. crowding any contracts on us, Andy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Verrall tells me they&rsquo;re coming back. At least, they&rsquo;re showing
      flirtatious signs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! I wonder what kind of a bargain they&rsquo;ll offer now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought to curb that mean, suspicious nature of yours, Boss,&rdquo; reproved
      Galpin solemnly. &ldquo;Now, <i>I</i> set it down to force of habit on the
      P.-U.&lsquo;s part. Something&rsquo;s in the air. Therefore they begin to advertise.
      It&rsquo;s the cuttle-fish principle. Only they use printer&rsquo;s ink.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s their little game?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Self-defense, I guess. The Governor is sharpening up his Corporation
      Control Bill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be for it. The P.-U. advertising won&rsquo;t make any difference.
      Montrose Clark ought to know that by this time. If he knows anything,&rdquo;
       qualified Jeremy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about President Puff. He knows a lot of things he did n&rsquo;t
      know before The Guardian tackled the job of his education. One of &rsquo;em
      is that the P.-U. is going to need just as much friendship and just as
      little enmity as it can get when this bill comes up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Clark is going to smooth us down with his advertising, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Andy lifted up his voice in pertinent song:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;There was a young man who said, &lsquo;Why

    <p class="indent15">
      Can&rsquo;t I look in my Ear with my Eye?
    </p>
    <p class="indent25">
      If I set my mind to it

    <p class="indent25">

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the P.-U. motto,&rdquo; he added; &ldquo;and a noble one it is. &lsquo;You never
      can tell till you try.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let &rsquo;em try somewhere else than in The Guardian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so, Boss,&rdquo; argued Galpin. &ldquo;This bill is rough stuff. It&rsquo;ll pretty
      near wipe out the P.-U. They&rsquo;re entitled to a yell, at least. Even Verrall
      admits that. And what Verrall won&rsquo;t swallow whole, when it comes from Mart
      Embree, must be tough swallowing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Verrall wants to make his advertising total as big as possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Being human&mdash;although an advertising manager&mdash;he does. Well,
      he&rsquo;s got no kick coming. Look at the clippings of your young friend and
      disciple, Mr. Buddy Higman. The Record is nowhere. Respected Sir and
      Editor, as your correspondents from the cheese district write; we&rsquo;re
      making money this year. Real, guaranteed money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough to take up our note?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why worry? The bank does n&rsquo;t. Old Warrington purrs like a cat every time
      he meets me. You can read in any witch-book that a banker purring like a
      cat is a sure sign of prosperity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s it in your scheme-hatching mind to do with all this prosperity,
      Andy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;New press,&rdquo; returned the general manager, who had been leading up to this
      point.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pro and con they argued it, the owner finally agreeing. &ldquo;We really owe it
      to the advertisers as well as the readers&rdquo; had been Andy&rsquo;s best argument.
      &ldquo;Look how they&rsquo;ve stuck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve had to,&rdquo; returned Jeremy grimly. &ldquo;Half of &rsquo;em would have
      got out at every bump if they had n&rsquo;t been afraid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;re solid with &rsquo;em now. Look what we did to &rsquo;em in
      April. Hiked the rates a clean ten per cent all around. And did they
      peep?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They did not. They howled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Force of habit again. They all came through, did n&rsquo;t they? We&rsquo;re making
      it pay &rsquo;em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re giving them all the return they&rsquo;re entitled to,&rdquo; agreed the editor.
      &ldquo;I wish I were as sure that we&rsquo;re giving the reading public as good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t hear many kicks, do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lots. If I did n&rsquo;t I&rsquo;d <i>know</i> we were rotten.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay-ah. That was a fool question of mine. But I mean, you can feel the
      paper taking hold all the time, can&rsquo;t you? We&rsquo;re certainly putting it
      over. We&rsquo;ve made a Governor already. What do you expect? Want to elect a
      President and Congress?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Governor is one of my troubles, Andy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Butting in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t call it that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can you call it?&rdquo; demanded the downright Galpin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, boosting. Without him we would n&rsquo;t be where we are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor anywhere else,&rdquo; added the other with emphasis. &ldquo;Probably not. I
      appreciate that. I&rsquo;d <i>give</i> him the paper, if he needed it, as far as
      that goes. But as long as my name is on it, I want it to be my paper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, &lsquo;Smiling Mart&rsquo; isn&rsquo;t trying to pry it away from you, is he?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not. It&rsquo;s hard to put into words. But I feel as if I&mdash;we&mdash;The
      Guardian were being surrounded by a sort of political web.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Governor being the spider?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. It&rsquo;s his web, in a way; but he is n&rsquo;t spinning it. It&rsquo;s being spun
      for him and for us. All our readers identify us completely with his
      policies. If I say anything editorially, it commits the Governor. People
      take it for granted that we &lsquo;re his mouthpiece. It is n&rsquo;t fair to him or
      to us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does he take advantage of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&mdash;ell; I don&rsquo;t know. He does n&rsquo;t mean to. Every now and then,
      though, something will come up where he wants us to do this or not to do
      that&mdash;always some unimportant thing&mdash;because of its influence on
      more important things that we &lsquo;re both interested in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for instance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take all this boosting, press-agent stuff that comes along and that
      Embree wants in,&rdquo; replied Jeremy. &ldquo;Sometimes it&rsquo;s political. Sometimes
      it&rsquo;s personal. Sometimes it&rsquo;s the German stuff that Wymett used to talk
      about. I&rsquo;ve got to admit that Embree&rsquo;s view is always for the practical
      good of the paper. By following his advice, we&rsquo;ve held sulky advertisers
      more than once. But I know this, I&rsquo;m doing for him&mdash;and for the
      politics of it&mdash;and for the paper itself, in a way, I guess&mdash;what
      I would n&rsquo;t do for any advertiser. And sometimes it&rsquo;s been a matter of
      principles. Not very important, maybe, but principles just the same.
      Compromise, Andy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Life&rsquo;s mostly compromise, I guess. There&rsquo;s a little more of it in the
      newspaper game than in other lines because the newspaper touches life at
      more points than any other business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always thought,&rdquo; pursued Jeremy, &ldquo;that when I came to own a
      newspaper it would be independent if it was n&rsquo;t anything else. Well, look
      at The Guardian!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay-ah. I&rsquo;m looking at it. What&rsquo;s wrong with it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s ducking a little here, and dodging a little there, and trying to be
      cautious about this issue and polite about that man, and so on. That is
      n&rsquo;t my notion of being independent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is? I guess we&rsquo;re as cocky as any paper in the country. You can&rsquo;t
      tell all the people to go to hell all the time,&rdquo; pointed out the general
      manager, reasonably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to. But I want to be able to if I do want to. Am I talking
      like a fool, Andy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; answered the other, troubled.
    </p>
    <p>
      A silence fell between them. Galpin whittled a pencil to so careful and
      delicate a point that it immediately broke. He repeated the experiment
      with like result before he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, Jem.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other looked up, attentive. Seldom, since their new relationship had
      the older man employed any formula of address other than the half-jocular,
      half-official, &ldquo;Boss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say it, Andy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are you making this paper for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Across the editor&rsquo;s face passed a swift shock, as of thought surprised and
      betrayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Making it for?&rdquo; he said slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay-ah. For yourself, I guess. Huh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it don&rsquo;t suit?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not altogether.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not good enough?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay-ah. I see.&rdquo; One of those extraordinary flashes of intuitive insight
      which sometimes pass electrically between surcharged and kindred minds,
      culminated in the general manager&rsquo;s next question. &ldquo;What does she think of
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who?&rdquo; The startled counter-question represented less than Jeremy&rsquo;s normal
      frankness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Andy rose and stood above the other. &ldquo;How should I know who? If I did I&rsquo;d
      know more about the paper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right.&rdquo; For the moment Jeremy was as intuitive as his friend. &ldquo;You
      think it would have been more honest of me, as I&rsquo;m making a paper for some
      one else, to let you in on it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does she think of The Guardian?&rdquo; persisted Andy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy stared out into the gray and bleak spaces. &ldquo;God knows,&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no way of finding out.&rdquo; Andy turned and went to the door. &ldquo;Forget
      it,&rdquo; he said. The tone was his sufficient apology.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      That night of June, 1914, two years after Marcia Ames&rsquo;s lips had pressed
      themselves to his cheek, and he had felt her sobbing breath on his face,
      Jeremy went again to the bridge where they had stood. A barge filled with
      young people passed the turn of the lake. A canoe bearing a boy and a girl&mdash;how
      young they seemed to lonely Jeremy, and how enviable!&mdash;floated
      beneath him, and their speech came up to him, dim, tender, and murmurous.
      Then, sped by a poignant magic, the blended voices of Marcia&rsquo;s song were
      wafted to him across the waters:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &ldquo;Who wins his love shall lose her,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Who loses her shall gain,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      For still the spirit wooes her,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      A soul without a stain,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      And Memory still pursues her
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      With longings not in vain!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      He could hear in the distance the faint plash of the oars that drove the
      boat of song. The fairy voices, fainter, sang:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &ldquo;He loses her who gains her,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Who watches, day by day,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      The dust of time...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The words were blurred as the unseen boat passed behind some unseen cape;
      then the music died on the breeze. Jeremy bent over the railing, where
      Marcia&rsquo;s hand had rested.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Half a world away an obscure fanatic, unknown to the world and to-day
      almost forgotten by it, was gloomily, lonelily, dreamily blending those
      common, inexpensive, terrific chemicals whereby he was to plunge
      civilization in carnage. The happy boats passed on. The happy voices
      blended again and were silenced. The busy presses chronicled the events of
      unsuspecting nations to little folk of souls yet untouched who, sleeping,
      &ldquo;rose up to buy and sell again.&rdquo; Then the bomb of the dreamy fanatic was
      flung, and in the force of that explosion, the wave of war, which had hung
      crested and suspended, broke and whelmed the world in such flood that the
      quicksands upon its edges spread even to far-away Fenchester.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER I
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>TRICKEN, at the
      first, by the unimaginable vastness of the tragedy which had befallen
      Europe, the State of Centralia quickly recovered, and lifted up a thousand
      voices of acclaim. Germany was being splendidly victorious. Nothing could
      stop the Kaiser&rsquo;s perfected war-machine; nothing stand against the valor
      and discipline of the field-gray legions. Triumph was a matter of only a
      few months; perhaps only a few weeks. France would be crushed; Russia
      humbled; England, the faithless and foolhardy, penned in her island and
      slowly starved into submission. Deutschland, Deutschland über Alles! The
      loyalest Imperial colony could hardly have rejoiced more openly or
      fervently than did Centralia, a sovereign State of the United States of
      America. Slow, still, systematic, scientific propagation of Deutschtum
      throughout the years now reaped its due reward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those there were in the State, and many, who revolted from the brutality
      of Germany&rsquo;s war-making. But what voice could they find in Centralia,
      where politicians and press and pulpit were dominated either by the
      influence or the fear of organized German sentiment? Let a man but speak a
      word against Germany&rsquo;s cause, and the anathema of Deutschtum descended
      upon him. A highly practical anathema, too; directed to his business
      affairs and even his social relations. The accusation of prejudice, of
      Wall Street influence, of British sympathies lay against any who dared
      question or criticize the &ldquo;necessary rigor&rdquo; of German methods. The rape of
      Belgium was hardly more triumphant than the seduction of Centralia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most conspicuous of the few who braved the local power of Deutschtum was
      Magnus Laurens. Less than a month after the declaration of war he spoke at
      a Manufacturers&rsquo; Association convention dinner in Bellair, the metropolis
      of the State. &ldquo;America and the Future&rdquo; was his topic. It should have been
      a safe topic; safe and sane, and in the hands of a less obstinately
      courageous partisan would have been. Indeed, for twenty minutes, it was.
      Then the speaker, setting back his massive shoulders, and with a
      significant deepening of his voice, challenged the sense of justice of the
      gathering, in these words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What future can America hope for if the policies of nations are to be
      dominated by the nation to whom the sacredest pledge is but a scrap of
      paper when it conflicts with her blood-stained ambitions?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gordon Fliess, the head of the great Fliess Breweries, was on his feet
      instantly. &ldquo;Order!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;The speaker is out of order, Mr.
      Chairman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Echoes came from all parts of the banqueting hall, mingled with cries of
      dissent. Laurens raised his great voice, and dominated the tumult. It was
      a reckless speech; it was violent; it was, in parts, unfair. But it raised
      a voice in Centralia that arraigned the State before a court of honor for
      self-judgment; a voice too powerful to be silenced, too clear to be
      ignored.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, instantly, the silencers were at work. Their first attempt was
      through the toastmaster who laid an arresting hand upon the speaker&rsquo;s arm,
      only to be shaken off with a violence which sufficiently warned him.
      Shouts, hoots, hisses, and cat-calls failed to make any impression on
      Laurens. Galvanized into action the reporters were taking down every word.
      But there descended upon them an emergency committee hastily constituted
      by Fliess, Mark Henkel, of the Henkel Casket Company, and other reliable
      Germans who not only warned them against publishing the proceedings, but
      also manned the telephones and issued their directions through owners,
      advertising managers, and editors regarding the event. Out of six dailies
      published in Bellair, only The Journal, already under suspicion because of
      its independence, reported the one sensational and interesting speech of
      the occasion. That single publication, however, gave the matter currency.
      The German dailies took it up virulently. The Journal was all but swamped
      with protests.
    </p>
    <p>
      Political matters had, on the day when the Laurens speech was published,
      brought Cassius Kimball, the managing editor and dominant spirit of The
      Journal, to Fenchester to see Governor Embree, whose fortunes the paper
      had early backed. After his call, the Governor sent for Robson. They had
      not seen each other since war began. Martin Embree&rsquo;s smile was happy as
      that of a boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Jem,&rdquo; was his greeting. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got him this time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Magnus Laurens. Did n&rsquo;t you see this morning&rsquo;s Bellair Journal?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just been reading it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That kills Laurens.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For everything and anything in this State. Governor&mdash;Legislature&mdash;dogcatcher;
      he couldn&rsquo;t get elected to anything, if this is handled properly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m giving his speech in full, in to-night&rsquo;s paper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it! And a slashing editorial to follow tomorrow. Eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Slashing which way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, into Laurens.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not me,&rdquo; declared Jeremy with more emphasis than grammar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would n&rsquo;t back him up!&rdquo; cried Embree.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in everything. There&rsquo;s a good deal in that speech, though, that
      needed to be said; that was <i>right</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jem, are you off your head?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never felt saner in my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They always say that just before they begin to bite the paper off the
      walls,&rdquo; smiled the other. &ldquo;Come, Jem! Here&rsquo;s our chance to put Laurens out
      of the game once and for all. Give me a column and I&rsquo;ll do it myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The chance &rsquo;ll have to wait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Until when?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Until he is n&rsquo;t as near right as he is on this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jem,&rdquo; said the Governor suddenly growing grave, &ldquo;why is it you&rsquo;re always
      pussy-footing when Laurens is in question?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like that word, Martin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Word the question to suit yourself, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t like the question. It reminds me that the last time I
      pussy-footed was on an issue that Laurens met fair and square.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it licked him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are worse things than being licked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s cant,&rdquo; retorted Embree promptly. &ldquo;When you&rsquo;re licked politically,
      you&rsquo;re through. You can&rsquo;t get anything done. Oh, I don&rsquo;t mean that I&rsquo;m
      afraid to fight a losing fight when a big principle is involved. My record
      shows that, plain enough. But this war is n&rsquo;t our fight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your view on the war, Mart?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It came in the nick of time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For us. For our programme. We can put through pretty much anything we
      want in the line of reform legislation. As long as the war continues, the
      German vote will stand by us almost solidly, if only we play fair with
      them. Even men like Wanser and Fliess and the big business crowd that have
      always fought us are ready to swing into line, if we don&rsquo;t rush things too
      hard. Why, Jem,&rdquo;&mdash;the keen, fine face lighted up with enthusiasm,&mdash;&ldquo;we
      can make Centralia the banner State of the country in social reform and
      popular rule.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As to rushing things, is n&rsquo;t this Corporation Control Bill a little
      rough?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s meant to be. It&rsquo;ll be toned down in conference. We made it pretty
      stiff to throw a scare into the P.-U. crowd. There won&rsquo;t be anything we
      can&rsquo;t do to those fellows, if the war keeps on long enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you really think about the invasion of Belgium, Martin?&rdquo; asked
      Jeremy abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hate the whole business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t like war, anyway. And this is part of war. I&rsquo;m going to keep
      my hands off. Neutrality is our watchword, Jem. The President has given it
      to us, and I guess in international affairs we can afford to follow the
      President. Let Magnus Laurens and his gang do the fireworks. They&rsquo;ll only
      burn their fingers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Belgium was neutral,&rdquo; said Jeremy gloomily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let Belgium alone and &rsquo;tend to Laurens.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But this the editor of The Guardian would not do. He ignored the
      Manufacturers&rsquo; Association banquet incident editorially. Publication of
      the mere report of the Laurens speech, however, stirred up a volume of
      local displeasure chiefly on the part of the Deutscher Club element, and
      The Guardian received some pointed letters on the subject of neutrality.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neutrality,&rdquo; commented Andrew Galpin thoughtfully to his chief. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
      good business for Mart Embree. He can preach neutrality and tickle the
      Germans at the same time, for our kind of neutrality in Centralia is sure
      hall-marked &lsquo;Made-in-Germany.&rsquo; But how neutral are <i>we</i> going to be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no such thing as &lsquo;how neutral.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, is n&rsquo;t there! Look here, Boss; what&rsquo;s practically every paper in this
      State, on this war, except The Bellair Journal?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;German. They&rsquo;re afraid not to be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose a paper is really neutral; gives both sides an equal show.
      What&rsquo;ll it look like where all the rest are pro-German? What&rsquo;d it look
      like in Germany?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I get your point, Andy. It will seem to lean to the Allies by contrast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There you are! Well, what are we going to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Play fair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure. But we can be cagey about it, can&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To what extent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough to live. I don&rsquo;t want to see The Guardian mess up in a fight
      that&rsquo;s none of our fight and get done up so bad that we can&rsquo;t help win the
      fight that is our fight. Let England lick Germany. Our business is to play
      the game here at home and lick the corporation crowd for legislative
      control of the State. Don&rsquo;t you think it&rsquo;s going to be a cinch, either,
      just because we&rsquo;ve elected Mart Embree Governor!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Expediency is a queer text for you, Andy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m all for expediency as against idiocy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about butting into the Wade riot?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was for a friend. War, right there under my nose. This other thing
      is four thousand miles away. And I hope it stays there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Andy,&rdquo; propounded his chief, &ldquo;what do you really think of the Governor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Smiling Mart&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that an answer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay-ah. I always wonder about one thing. If you brushed that smile off
      quick, what &rsquo;d be under it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He asked me to sit in his box at the convention meeting of the Federated
      German Societies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you got an invitation from the Societies, did you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Issued by Bausch as secretary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I bet he spit in the ink before he signed it. Going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Expediency again, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay-ah. There&rsquo;s no principle in turning down an invitation, even if it <i>will</i>
      do us some good!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Andy. I&rsquo;ll go,&rdquo; laughed the editor.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat in the Governor&rsquo;s box at the meeting. There was the same
      pan-Germanic atmosphere that there had been two years before, but
      magnified. The Imperial banners were more flamboyant, more triumphant. The
      verve and swing of &ldquo;Deutschland, Deutschland über Alles,&rdquo; was more
      martial; it defied the world. The speeches were more fiery, more
      challenging, more instinct with the fierce pride of a dominant
      nationalism; and again Jeremy felt resentfully, in the references to the
      adoptive republic, that tone of bland and intolerable condescension to a
      lesser people.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Governor&rsquo;s box was that which Magnus Laurens had occupied in 1912.
      Sitting well back in it, Jeremy faced the high balcony. In the far corner
      a fat, steamy German in a fancy waistcoat roared out &ldquo;Hochs!&rdquo; of assent
      and applause to the speakers. But before Jeremy&rsquo;s wistful vision he
      dissolved, giving place to another figure; a figure slender, gallant,
      boyish, erect. Martin Embree&rsquo;s touch on his knee recalled Jeremy to
      realities.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wake up, Jem! What ghosts are you seeing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None. Nothing,&rdquo; muttered Jeremy, and stood while the fervid gathering
      sang thunderously &ldquo;Die Wacht am Rhein.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>

      CHAPTER II
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>TEP by step The
      Guardian followed the war through its pregnant early days. In presentation
      of the news, both Jeremy and Galpin strove to be conscientiously neutral.
      For Galpin, this was simple enough. It accorded with his creed, that the
      news should stand of itself and for itself and let the people judge.
      Jeremy took it harder. There were times when, in the security of his den,
      he fingered his pencil with a fierce and mounting resentment which cried
      for expression toward Germany&rsquo;s savagery and terrorism. On the other hand,
      he knew that to incite prejudices, wrath, and hatred within America, and
      particularly within so divided a State as his own, was to thrust the
      nation nearer to that hell&rsquo;s caldron wherein Europe agonized. The
      President had prescribed neutrality. That, Jeremy recognized, was the part
      of statesmanship. He appeased his own soul with the argument that it was
      equally the part of honorable journalism.
    </p>
    <p>
      If he had thought by editorial silence to satisfy or even conciliate the
      propagandists of Deutschtum in the State, he was soon undeceived. The
      process of the absorption of Centralia by the German-Americans was swiftly
      progressing, and as a newspaper of influence, The Guardian came within the
      purview of their programme. Daily the mail deposited upon his desk a
      swelling flood of proselytizing literature; pamphlets, reprints, letters
      to the editor from writers whom he had never heard of (and who in many
      cases had no existence) as well as from his own clientèle, excerpts from
      the German press, editorials from that great and malign force in American
      journalism who, already secretly plotting with Germany, was playing the
      game of Teutonic diplomacy by inciting fear and distrust of Japan and
      shouting for war upon and annexation of Mexico. He could not have
      published one twentieth of them. He did not publish one one-hundredth of
      them. Hardly a day passed without his being stopped on the street by some
      sorrowful or accusing or indignant subscriber who wished to know why The
      Guardian had not reproduced Pastor Klink&rsquo;s powerful editorial on &ldquo;The
      Crusader Spirit of Germany,&rdquo; or how it happened that The Record printed
      Mr. Woeker&rsquo;s letter on Belgian provocations while The Guardian had n&rsquo;t a
      word of it. Suspicion established itself in the editor&rsquo;s mind that some
      person or persons were making daily and scientific analysis of his
      newspaper for the purpose of forcing propaganda upon it by the power of
      protest. He suspected, and with reason, the Deutscher Club.
    </p>
    <p>
      The matter of news soon became an irritant to the apostles of Deutschtum.
      To the layman, news is simple fact, the product of the world&rsquo;s activities,
      finished and ready for the press. To the expert journalist news is a theme
      and the printed page his instrument whereon he may render that theme by an
      infinite variety of inflections and with infinitely varying effect upon
      his public. Headlines and sub-heads alone may vitally alter the whole
      purport of an article not otherwise garbled. So long as Germany&rsquo;s record
      was one of consistent victories, the course of the Centralia newspapers
      was clearly marked. They had but to print the cables with captions
      appropriate to the facts, in order to please their self-appointed masters,
      the German-American public. But Russia now made her sensational advance.
      Victory in the West was threatened by disaster in the East. Much ingenious
      and painful juggling of cable news was imposed upon the harassed
      journalistic fraternity of Centralia by this unfortunate development.
      Relegating the Russian campaign to nooks and corners of the inner pages and
      qualifying it by indeterminate or sometimes satiric headlines, was the
      most generally approved method. The Guardian, however, printed the news.
      It printed it straight, for what it was worth, and under appropriate
      captions. Somewhat to Jeremy&rsquo;s surprise and more to his relief, the
      Governor had no criticism to make of this course.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So long as you stick to facts, we&rsquo;ve got a good defense,&rdquo; was his view.
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll kick. Of course they&rsquo;ll kick. Let &rsquo;em. In time they&rsquo;ll
      come to see that they&rsquo;re really kicking against the facts, not against The
      Guardian. Just now our German friends are pretty excited and touchy and
      nervous. If you could give &rsquo;em a little more show on the editorial
      page, while this Russian business is on, it&rsquo;d help.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kick the German-Americans certainly did, by pen and Voice. No less a
      person than Robert Wanser, who had maintained a mere bowing acquaintance
      with Jeremy since the Cultural Language Bill episode, took it upon himself
      to voice a protest to General Manager Galpin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why print this Russian claptrap at all?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the papers are carrying it,&rdquo; answered Galpin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so much of it, and not so prominently as The Guardian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re giving it what it&rsquo;s worth as news, just as we give the German
      advances in the West.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everybody knows that it isn&rsquo;t news. It is British fabrications, put on
      the tables to fool&mdash;er&mdash;influenceable newspapers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Influenceable, eh?&rdquo; said Galpin, annoyed. &ldquo;Everybody knows, do they? You
      prove it to us, and we&rsquo;ll print it, all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are making a mistake,&rdquo; pronounced the banker severely. &ldquo;For a
      newspaper to take up the British side is very suspicious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bunk! The Guardian&rsquo;s been square, and you know it. But we&rsquo;re not going to
      stand for being censored by a lot of organized letter-writers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A(c)h, censored!&rdquo; The banker&rsquo;s guttural almost emerged upon the troubled
      surface of speech. &ldquo;The censoring is inside your editorial office, if
      anywhere. You refuse to publish our letters&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Our&rsquo;? Have you been writing us letters?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have sent you letters.&rdquo; Mr. Wanser&rsquo;s face became red.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Funny! I don&rsquo;t recall any. Sign &rsquo;em?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They were signed,&rdquo; returned the other, with an effort at loftiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With what name?&rdquo; demanded Galpin bluntly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not here to be cross-examined by you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You started this. And now you want to duck it. Nothing doing! You let out
      what we&rsquo;ve suspected; that a lot of those letters are machine-made, and
      sent in signed with fake names or with real names stuck on as a blind for
      some committee. That don&rsquo;t go, in The Guardian. We&rsquo;ve had too much stuff
      put over on us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The banker&rsquo;s dignity dissolved in wrath. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you get fresh with me,
      young man. I guess you and your boss, too, are going to learn something
      one of these days! Going out of your way to insult the best citizens in
      the State every time your dirty, pro-English paper&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you make me sick!&rdquo; said Galpin, and marched away, leaving Wanser
      brandishing a denunciatory fist at nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The split between the Germans and The Guardian imperceptibly widened, as
      time went on, through minor incidents, arguments, and abortive attempts at
      influence. Seizing upon its opportunity, The Record accepted the whole
      programme of local German censorship, published nothing that could
      possibly offend, trimmed its news to the prejudices of the dominant
      element, and by these methods cut in upon its rival&rsquo;s local circulation.
      Verrall, however, reported that as yet there was nothing to worry about,
      while at the same time earnestly advocating an inoffensive foreign news
      policy for The Guardian. So 1914 passed into 1915, and the paper held its
      own.
    </p>
    <p>
      On a mid-April day of 1915 there appeared upon an inner page of The
      Guardian, an item of such overwhelming importance, that when the editor
      and owner read it, all other news of the day receded and blurred into a
      dull, colorless mist of insignificance. The article stated briefly that
      Miss Marcia Ames, cousin of Miss Letitia Pritchard, of 11 Montgomery
      Street, who was well known to Fenchester society, not only for her charm
      and beauty, but also as being the only lady intercollegiate golf-player in
      the country, had left Berne, whither she had gone after the breaking-out
      of the war, and was visiting friends in Copenhagen. Her many and admiring
      friends would be glad to learn, etc., etc., in the best
      society-reportorial formula. After thoroughly absorbing that paragraph
      into his inmost being, Jeremy sent for Buddy Higman, who had now taken on
      the additional duty of marking each day&rsquo;s paper, from the assignment book,
      article by article, with the name of the writer of each.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Buddy,&rdquo; said the editor, &ldquo;whose is the Ames story?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This being an official query, Buddy made pretense of consulting his marked
      file. &ldquo;Higman, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! You wrote it? Did you have a letter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir. But I did n&rsquo;t write it from that. I would n&rsquo;t make a story out
      of a letter from Her. That&rsquo;s personal,&rdquo; said Buddy, proud in his rigid
      sense of ethics.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then where did you get it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I figured that like as not Miss Pritchard would get one by the same mail.
      So I went an&rsquo; ast her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And she had?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir. I told her I was there for The Guardian an&rsquo; was there anything
      she could give out. An&rsquo; she gimme the story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Buddy, if you don&rsquo;t look out you&rsquo;re going to be a real newspaper man one
      of these days!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wisht I was one now,&rdquo; returned the boy wistfully. &ldquo;Do you? What would
      you do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dunno, exactly. Somethin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;d need a more definite policy than that, son, if you were in the bad
      fix of owning a newspaper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d do somethin&rsquo;,&rdquo; persisted the boy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d soak the Germans. Say, Boss,
      how old do you have to be to get into the National Guard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A good deal older than you are. Why all this martial ardor, Buddy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what She&rsquo;d do, if She was a man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did the letter say so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Can a feller&mdash;is it ever all right for a feller to show a
      lady&rsquo;s letter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wondering again as he had wondered before whence this freckled scrub of a
      boy had derived his instincts of the gentleman born and bred, Jeremy
      answered gravely: &ldquo;It might be. That&rsquo;s for you to decide, Buddy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I kinda guess She&rsquo;d like for you to see this.&rdquo; He dug out of his pocket a
      crumpled sheet, covered with the strong, straight, beautiful script of
      Marcia. &ldquo;Read there, Boss.&rdquo; He indicated an inner page.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;...or later it must come,&rdquo; the letter ran. &ldquo;As soon as you are old enough
      you must learn to be a soldier. Every one in the world who can, must learn
      to be a soldier. I cannot tell you, Buddy, of the terrible thing that
      German national ambition is; how it reaches out into every nation to make
      that nation its tool; how it aims to overrun the world and make it one
      vast Germany. You will be old enough soon to see what it is doing in your
      own little city, so far away. Perhaps you do not comprehend. Perhaps you
      will not understand even what I am writing; but you may find some one on
      your paper who will know and will explain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think, perhaps, I was meant to see this, Buddy,&rdquo; interjected Jeremy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I guess I know what She was drivin&rsquo; at all right,&rdquo; replied the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can America be so blind!&rdquo; Jeremy read on. &ldquo;How can its newspapers be
      so blind! The last numbers of The Guardian that I saw, no word of arousing
      the people to a sense of what all this means. Oh, Buddy, Buddy! If you
      were only a man and had a newspaper of your own! I have written your aunt
      about the books and...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The bottom of the page terminated the reading. Jeremy, with his lips set
      straight and hard, handed back the sheet. The boy faced him with a candid
      eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boss, you&rsquo;re a man,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I?&rdquo; said Jeremy, more to himself than in reply. &ldquo;And you got a
      noospaper of your own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not of my own, wholly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; cried Buddy, amazed. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s in on it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The people who read it, and believe in it. It&rsquo;s partly theirs. The men I
      work with to help keep politics straight and fair. I have to think of
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Buddy sighed. &ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t as big a cinch as it looks, ownin&rsquo; a paper, is
      it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not these days, son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anyway, I guess She knows,&rdquo; asseverated the stout little loyalist. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s
      lived there an&rsquo; she oughta know. What She says goes, with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The clear single-mindedness of a boy! How the editor of The Guardian,
      feeling a thousand years old, envied his lowliest assistant! How the
      unstilled ache for Marcia woke and throbbed again at her words! She had
      begged him not wholly to forget her. Had it been a spell laid upon him it
      could have been no more compelling. He wondered whether, twenty years
      hence, her influence would have become less vital, less intimate upon him,
      and, wondering, knew that it would not.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went home deviously by way of Montgomery Street. The early shoots had
      lanced their way into the sunshine of the Pritchard garden, and Miss
      Letitia was making her rounds, inspecting for the winter-killed amongst
      the tenderer of her shrubbery. Jeremy leaned upon the fence saying
      nothing. There were reasons why he felt hesitant about approaching Miss
      Pritchard. In his campaign against the tax-dodgers he had fallen foul of
      old Madam Taylor, one of her particular friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shortly after the publication, Miss Pritchard, meeting Jeremy at her own
      front gate as he was about to enter, had presented the danger signal of
      two high-colored spots upon the cheek-curves, and a pair of specially
      bright eyes; also the theorem, for his acceptance, that a newspaper ought
      to be in better business than attacking and abusing lone and defenseless
      women. Declining to accept this theorem without debate, Jeremy was
      informed that Miss Pritchard would disdain thenceforth to harbor The
      Guardian upon her premises. Interpreting this to mean that the editor of
      that fallen sheet would be equally unwelcome, the caller had departed,
      divided between wrath and melancholy. Up to that time the Pritchard house
      had been one of the few ports of call in his busy but rather lonely life.
      Now, another of those gossamer links with Marcia Ames was severed. Miss
      Pritchard soon came to regret her severity, too; for the steadfast,
      unspoken, hopeless devotion of the boy&mdash;he was still only that to her&mdash;to
      the memory of her golden girl, had bloomed for her like one of the flowers
      in her old maid&rsquo;s garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, seeing the lover, forlorn and mute, outside what was once his
      paradise, she gave way to compunction. But not wholly. There was a sting
      in her first words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you reckoning up taxes on my place, Mr. Jeremy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s been done long ago,&rdquo; he said uncompromisingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When are you going to print it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As soon as you try to dodge &rsquo;em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked very tired, and his voice had lost something of the buoyant
      quality of youth which she had always associated with him. A different
      note crept into her own when she spoke again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had a long letter from Marcia to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she well?&rdquo; The tone was politely formal, but she saw the color rise in
      his face and marked the pathetic eagerness in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s the same Marcia Ames. Even to the name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He caught at the opportunity. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s not married yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Her fiancé is fighting. Somewhere in the remote colonies, I believe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fiancé?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely you knew that she was engaged; a young cousin of her stepfather&rsquo;s.
      It was an affair of years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not when she was here,&rdquo; Jeremy blurted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her surprised regard challenged him. &ldquo;You seem very certain,&rdquo; she
      observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy recovered himself. &ldquo;I had heard rumors, but nothing formal,&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;I thought perhaps you would have told me when it was announced.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I assumed that you knew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What Miss Pritchard meant was, &ldquo;I assumed that she would have told you.&rdquo;
       She perceived that there were depths in this affair of which she knew
      little or nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;German betrothals are curious and formal things in her class,&rdquo; continued
      the old maid. &ldquo;When she came here, to &lsquo;see America first,&rsquo; I believe it
      was understood that nothing was to be settled until her return. She went
      back, and the formalities were arranged. At the outbreak of war her fiancé
      was somewhere in Africa and, I believe, is still there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Jeremy dully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marcia still sees The Guardian.&rdquo; The spirit of romance in the spinster
      heart <i>would</i> force the words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know. And that helps. Good-bye and thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come to see me and let&rsquo;s be friends again,&rdquo; said the warm-hearted lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of that night Jeremy spent on the tramp, thinking of The Guardian in
      terms of Marcia&rsquo;s letter; haggardly struggling to harmonize
      cross-interests, cross-purposes, cross-loyalties. Out of the struggle
      emerged one clear resolve. What next the progress of the war should
      produce that intimately touched his conscience, should be the signal, the
      release. Upon that The Guardian should speak its owner&rsquo;s mind though
      damnation follow.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">L</span>IKE a portent of
      stern events to come, The Guardian&rsquo;s Lusitania editorial laid hold on the
      collective mind of Fenchester. It was a hand set against every man&rsquo;s
      breast, bidding him stop as he went about his occupations, and summon his
      own soul to ponder what a German war might mean. &ldquo;The Black Flag,&rdquo; Jeremy
      had captioned it. Simple and grim words were its medium, and the burden of
      its charge was plain murder.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first effect was that of any profound and pervasive shock; the
      community lay quiet, collecting and rallying its forces. Until now, no
      newspaper in the State of Centralia had dared lift voice against the
      cumulative outrages of the conquerors, fearful as all were of the
      coordinated forces of German sentiment, ready and under arms for the call.
      To what the initial outbreak might spread, no man could foretell. It was
      not so much a high explosive as a fire-bomb that The Guardian had cast.
    </p>
    <p>
      The German press ravened. The dailies howled for the blood of the
      dastardly and treacherous Robson. They called upon the authorities to
      suppress The Guardian, without troubling to specify upon what ground. They
      summoned the Governor to cut loose from a supporter so violent, so
      vicious, so filled with the spirit of hatred and contention. The German
      religious press backed up the attack, and even improved upon it. It
      declared The Guardian and its owner enemies to an all-wise,
      all-beneficent, and all-German Gott, and shrieked inquisitorially for a
      holy ban upon it. All of which, combined, failed to keep Jeremy awake o&rsquo;
      nights. Indeed, it had quite the reverse effect. For the first time in
      months he fell asleep at peace with his own soul, and awoke with
      untainted, new-found courage to face whatever the day might bring.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day brought Cassius Kimball, of The Bellair Journal. He was a slow,
      cautious, weary, high-minded, and plucky man of forty-five who looked
      sixty behind his lines and his glasses, and he eyed Jeremy, his devoted
      admirer, with a benign but puzzled expression as he sat in the office
      spare chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I&rsquo;d said it first,&rdquo; was his opening remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you had,&rdquo; returned Jeremy, quite honestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never say anything first. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m really not much good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy laughed. From the most independent and battle-scarred veteran of
      Middle Western journalism, this was funny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fact, though,&rdquo; continued the tired voice. &ldquo;I always think too
      slow. What are you going to do next?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Next?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About the Lusitania issue. You&rsquo;ve started it in Centralia. Nothing can
      put out that fire. It may die down and only smoulder. But the embers will
      be there. And nobody can tell when they&rsquo;ll reach a powder magazine. Have
      you seen the recent Eastern papers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A lot of them are yelling for war. It&rsquo;s going to be put up to the
      President pretty stiff. What are you going to do about that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The gravity of the tone, almost amounting to deference, made Jeremy
      tingle. Here was the greatest journalistic power in Centralia, a man whose
      clarity and courage of spirit had won for him an almost hierarchic
      ascendency in his profession, ascribing such importance to the course of
      The Guardian that he had taken the four-hour journey from Bellair to
      consult its owner. To do Jeremy justice, his pride was for the paper,
      semi-impersonal, rather than for himself. To the question he had no ready
      answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had n&rsquo;t thought it out yet. What&rsquo;s your idea?&rdquo; Kimball took off his
      glasses and wiped them carefully. His eyes, without them, seemed squinted
      and anxious. He drummed on the desk a moment before replying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a man down in Washington,&rdquo; he said in his gentle, reasonable
      voice, &ldquo;with a hard job on his hands. He has a lot of decisions to make
      every day. We newspaper men have the same kind of decisions, but where
      ours affect a few thousands, his affect a hundred millions. From now on
      he&rsquo;s going to have bigger decisions put up to him. He can lift his hand
      and there&rsquo;ll be war to-morrow, and six months from to-morrow there&rsquo;ll be
      thousands of us back home here in mourning. It&rsquo;s a hard decision, Mr.
      Robson. You and I did our best to beat the President for election. We&rsquo;ve
      differed from him in many things. But this is n&rsquo;t politics. It&rsquo;s something
      else now. And, knowing what he&rsquo;s got to face, I don&rsquo;t feel exactly like
      yelling in the President&rsquo;s ears.&rdquo; He resumed his glasses. &ldquo;Seen the
      Governor since your editorial?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. He&rsquo;s up at his home in Spencerville.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be put up to him pretty hard, too. Your outbreak is
      responsible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The German legislative outfit in Bellair,&rdquo; said Kimball, who had an
      uncanny knack of knowing things before they were ready to be known, &ldquo;is
      cooking up a bill to offset your editorial. They intend to put the State
      on record. The bill will call on the President and Congress to declare
      that any American sailing on a ship of a belligerent nation forfeits all
      right to the protection of his own country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will The Journal do about that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fight it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can we beat it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. But the Governor can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! What do you think? You&rsquo;re closer to him than any one else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy shook his head. &ldquo;Not on the war. I don&rsquo;t even know what he&rsquo;s
      thinking, most of the time. Your paper has more influence with him than
      The Guardian. If I could think of Martin Embree as being afraid of
      anybody, I&rsquo;d say he was a little afraid of The Journal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, he doesn&rsquo;t want to lose us,&rdquo; answered Kimball reflectively.
      &ldquo;He can&rsquo;t afford to lose us. But there isn&rsquo;t much danger of that.&rdquo; He
      rose. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll send you a word before the bill is ready. They intend to
      spring it suddenly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy thanked him, and after he had left, sat down to think out the
      Governor&rsquo;s situation. He could appreciate its perplexities. He could
      foresee that Embree would blame him for stirring up dissension
      unnecessarily, when he might have held his peace. Therefore he was
      prepared for a difficult interview when, on the Governor&rsquo;s return, he was
      invited to lunch with him. But &ldquo;Smiling Mart&rsquo;s&rdquo; smile was as open and
      friendly as ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You dipped your pen in earthquake and eclipse that time, my boy,&rdquo; he
      observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had to speak out or blow up, Martin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Therefore you did both. Up in the Northern Tier you&rsquo;re not precisely
      popular.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. The circulation reports show that. We&rsquo;re getting two or three dozen
      stop-the-paper orders from there per day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done my best for you, there. But I can&rsquo;t hold the more rabid
      elements. There&rsquo;s one saving grace, though.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve gone no further than criticism. You didn&rsquo;t even hint at war.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m not going to. Not on this issue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Martin Embree drew a long, slow, luxurious breath. &ldquo;Thank God for that! At
      least they can&rsquo;t identify us with the war-howlers in the East.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy passed the &ldquo;us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your view of the Lusitania sinking, Martin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s damnable. But it&rsquo;s war.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;German war. They&rsquo;re holding jollifications over it here. There&rsquo;s to be
      one to-night at the Deutscher Club.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a formal thing?&rdquo; cried the Governor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bausch and Henry Vogt, the florist, are engineering it, I understand. It
      is n&rsquo;t exactly a club affair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! That&rsquo;s not so bad. You&rsquo;re not going to print anything about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d print their remarks about The Guardian if I could get &rsquo;em,&rdquo;
       grinned Jeremy. &ldquo;They&rsquo;d be spicy. But of course they won&rsquo;t admit
      reporters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What goes on at a private dinner is nobody&rsquo;s business,&rdquo; said the relieved
      official. &ldquo;So you don&rsquo;t need to stir up any more trouble for yourself on
      that score. Some of the smaller German organizations have been passing
      resolutions about The Guardian. That will cut into your circulation, won&rsquo;t
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To some extent. But we&rsquo;re holding up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just keep your head, Jem, and we&rsquo;ll be all right,&rdquo; advised the Governor
      anxiously. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget that we&rsquo;ve got measures to put through here at
      home more important than a war four thousand miles away. Harvey Rappelje,
      of the Economics Department of the University, is working on the
      Corporation Control Bill now. I&rsquo;m going to have him talk it over with you
      when it&rsquo;s ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glad to see him. Speaking of bills, Martin, what do you know of a bill
      drawn by a bunch of Bellair Germans, to keep Americans off British
      passenger ships?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing. And I don&rsquo;t want to until I have to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;ll be soon,&rdquo; prophesied Jeremy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to fight that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that,&rdquo; doubted the other. &ldquo;There are two sides to all
      these questions, remember.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are two sides to the war. Admitted. But there&rsquo;s only one side to
      Americanism. And this is a question of American rights.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But is it quite fair to our Cause, to endanger it now for an issue that
      you are n&rsquo;t called on to meet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If our cause isn&rsquo;t American, then The Guardian is going to quit it,&rdquo;
       retorted Jeremy heatedly. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s more, Martin, if I ever had to suspect
      that when the issue comes you would n&rsquo;t be for America against&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop right there!&rdquo; the other adjured him, laughing. &ldquo;When you hear me
      speak an un-American word or see me do an un-American act, it will be time
      enough to worry. But in the business now on hand we need those German
      votes, and I&rsquo;ll do just as much to hold them as you can to drive them
      away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On his return trip to the office, Jeremy encountered Eli Wade, the Boot
      &amp; Shoe Surgeon, and Nick Milliken. Wade shook hands with him, and
      looked at his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re standing solid now, Mr. Robson,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I went on my knees and
      thanked God when I read your editorial.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not me,&rdquo; put in Milliken. &ldquo;That ain&rsquo;t my God. I don&rsquo;t worship Mars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t heed him, Mr. Robson. He&rsquo;ll fight, too, when the time comes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a capitalistic war? Do I look as soft a mark as that!&rdquo; retorted the
      Socialist disdainfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In an American war,&rdquo; said Eli Wade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think it! Nine tenths of the people are dead against war.
      There&rsquo;s a bill coming up this session that&rsquo;ll tell the war-birds where
      they get off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did you learn about it?&rdquo; asked Jeremy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Party is going to back it. It&rsquo;ll carry without any trouble. The
      yellow-bellies won&rsquo;t dare kick for fear of the German vote.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then they might as well raise the German flag over the Capitol,&rdquo; declared
      the Boot &amp; Shoe Surgeon fiercely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;German nothing! We&rsquo;ll have the red flag of brotherhood there yet, Eli.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Considerations of policy delayed the presentation of the bill. When it was
      offered, Jeremy put it on record all over the State, in an editorial of
      protest, dubbing it the &ldquo;Surrender Bill.&rdquo; But no leader could be found in
      the Legislature who dared back this bold course. German intimidation had
      done its work too well. The most that the opponents of the bill ventured
      was to obstruct its passage by parliamentary obstacles. Even that much
      brought down upon the offender the threats of an organized Deutschtum. But
      the matter bumped and dawdled along the legislative road all that spring
      and summer before the bill passed to a final reading. Jeremy published his
      last editorial on the subject &ldquo;Hands Off the President,&rdquo; solemnly warning
      the Legislature against interfering in international matters of which they
      could know little or nothing. The Record replied with a scathing &ldquo;leader&rdquo;
       denouncing The Guardian, under the caption &ldquo;An Insult to Our State,&rdquo; the
      purport of which was that Centralia possessed the patriotism,
      statesmanship, and wisdom embodied in its Legislature to lay out the
      course for the ship of state through the most perilous waters. It was the
      kind of claptrap which rallies pseudo-patriotism and emboldens vacillating
      politicians.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bill passed in the fall by a ratio of two to one. Deutschtum rejoiced
      exuberantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy hurried to the Executive Mansion. &ldquo;Governor, are you going to veto
      that bill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this for publication, Mr. Editor?&rdquo; smiled the Governor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I will say that the matter is still under advisement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a rank surrender, Martin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a silly bill, Jem. But where&rsquo;s the harm? Let &rsquo;em blow off
      steam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you won&rsquo;t veto it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I certainly shall not. Does The Guardian propose to scarify me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My Lord, Martin! A matter as serious as this&mdash;I don&rsquo;t see how you
      can take it so lightly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Philosophy, my boy. With our Corporation Bill coming on soon I&rsquo;m
      certainly not going to compromise its chances by flying in the face of the
      whole German-American vote.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But on a question of national honor&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;National flapdoodle! Our national honor is safe enough as long as we keep
      our heads. Will you see Rappelje to-morrow about the Corporation Control
      Bill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. To-morrow afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lean and dry authority on economics, an ardent apostle of Embree&rsquo;s
      policies and his chief adviser on all corporation matters, spent an hour
      in the editorial den of The Guardian. All points of the bill were
      carefully discussed. Jeremy committed his unqualified editorial support to
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you forward it to Mr. Kimball, of The Bellair Journal?&rdquo; asked the
      professor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, if you wish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can be sure of his aid?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably. Though he will be very sore on Governor Embree if the
      &lsquo;Surrender Bill&rsquo; is signed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That has no bearing whatsoever upon this measure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only as a matter of political barter and trade. What do you think of the
      &lsquo;Surrender Bill&rsquo; yourself, Professor Rappelje?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was requested to come here to discuss the Corporation Control Act,&rdquo;
       returned the economist austerely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another dodger!&rdquo; thought Jem disgustedly, as he bade his visitor a
      somewhat curt good-day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such advisement as Governor Embree bestowed upon the &ldquo;Surrender Bill&rdquo; was
      brief. Two days after its passage he signed it without comment. Jeremy&rsquo;s
      editorial on the final step in the enactment was dignified and regretful,
      but carefully guarded against offense. It indicated plainly that there
      would be no split between The Guardian and the Governor.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the morning following the signature, as Jeremy was at his desk, Andrew
      Galpin burst in upon him, his face vivid with emotions in which unholy
      glee, such as might be evoked by some Satanic jest, seemed to predominate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come out here!&rdquo; he gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; demanded his Boss, struggling against a powerful
      grip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come out. I can&rsquo;t tell it. You&rsquo;ve got to see it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Galpin hurried him downstairs and out upon the sidewalk. The street was
      full of people with faces turned upward and to the northeast where Capitol
      Hill reared its height. The typical characteristic of the faces was a
      staringly incredulous eye and a fallen jaw. Jeremy followed the line of
      vision to the dome wherefrom projected the State&rsquo;s official flagstaff.
    </p>
    <p>
      In place of the Stars and Stripes there blew, stiff in the brisk wind, the
      banner of Imperial Germany.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">P</span>HENOMENA do not
      occur upon legislative flag-staffs without due process. The astonishing
      manifestation of a sardonic intent above the unconscious lawmakers of
      Centralia was not the fruit of magic, black or white, but of a simple and
      easy substitution. The legitimate ornament of the staff was lowered each
      evening into a box, where it lay, still attached to its halyards, and was
      raised therefrom in the morning by an assistant janitor who, operating the
      rope from within the dome, never saw the flag as it mounted to the peak.
      What more easy, since the dome was always open and unguarded, than for
      some demoniac-souled satirist to ascend to the repository and substitute
      an alien banner, always supposing him able to lay possessive hands upon
      such a thing? Since the Lusitania rejoicings, German flags had blossomed
      broadcast in the streets of Fenchester, and each new submarine success had
      brought them forth afresh. As a matter of fact, the satirical substituter
      had borrowed the Deutscher Club&rsquo;s proud insignium.
    </p>
    <p>
      How would the German-Americans take it? That was the first question in the
      minds of Jeremy Robson and Andrew Galpin alike. When the first shock of
      amazement wore off, it began to appear that they were taking it with a
      certain gusto. A joke? Oh, certainly! But a joke with a deserved sting in
      it for the &ldquo;Know-Nothings,&rdquo; the jingo-patriots who could admit no other
      nationality than their own to any rightful say in American affairs.
      Privately they were much inclined to chuckle. The forehanded among them
      hastened forth with cameras to perpetuate the spicy relish of their flag
      exalted in the high place of the State. While the click of shutters was at
      its height, the flag came down. Somebody in the Main Square shouted &ldquo;Hoch
      der Kaiser!&rdquo; and there was a burst of laughter and applause.
    </p>
    <p>
      But for that, casual and insignificant as it was, Jeremy Robson might have
      treated the matter tactfully, or jocularly, as did The Record. But that
      heavy, Teutonic mirth roused a dogged wrath within him. What he composed
      for a &ldquo;box&rdquo; on that evening&rsquo;s editorial page was unpleasant writing and
      extremely unpleasant reading. There were but few sentences, but they
      stung. And that which rankled was the suggestion that the insult to the
      State and the Nation was fittingly typified in the flag from that
      organization which had jubilated in wine and song over the murder of
      American women and children aboard the Lusitania.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the editorial had been out two hours there were rumors of a mob
      that was to be raised against The Guardian. Jeremy returned to the office.
      So did Galpin; also Verrall, white with consternation and chagrin over the
      reckless challenge of the editorial which could not fail to prejudice the
      circulation and advertising of the paper; and a dozen other of the staff.
      At eight o&rsquo;clock the rhythm of marching feet sounded, and the tumult of
      voices. Five hundred undergraduates from Old Central massed in the street
      before the office and gave the University&rsquo;s three times three for The
      Guardian and its owner. The rumor had come to them. They were there to
      tackle any mob that arrived seeking trouble. None materialized. The
      students stayed and sang and cheered until midnight, and then dispersed.
      More than the protection offered, to those of The Guardian, was the proof
      that Young America at least was still American to the core, without taint
      of doubt or hyphen!
    </p>
    <p>
      The mob-rumor had been a canard. Organizations such as the Deutscher Club
      do not raise mobs. They sit in solemn conclave, when action is called for,
      and appoint proper committees. Insult gross and profound having been
      offered Fenchester&rsquo;s leading social organization, its president summoned
      the Board of Governors, which in turn appointed a Special Committee with
      instructions. The first act of the committee was to advertise a liberal
      reward for the &ldquo;apprehension of the criminal miscreant&rdquo;&mdash;to such
      heights of expressiveness did righteous indignation run&mdash;who had
      filched the club&rsquo;s flag. The second was to send a sub-committee to call
      upon Mr. Jeremy Robson, owner and responsible editor of that libertine
      sheet, The Guardian. Chance may or may not have dictated that two of the
      committee, Arnold Blasius, the hatter, and Nicholas Engel, the grocer,
      should be important local advertisers. The chairman was Emil Bausch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Forewarned of their coming, Jeremy had Andrew Galpin on hand. The two
      young makers of The Guardian, shirt-sleeved and alert, received the
      black-coated delegation of clubmen, formal and accusing, in the inner den.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have come to demand a full retragtion,&rdquo; Emil Bausch opened the ball.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unhappily, since his first interview with that dignitary, Jeremy had been
      invariably afflicted with mingled exasperation and amusement at Bausch&rsquo;s
      every action. The apostle of Deutschtum roused within Jeremy an impulse of
      perversity which flatly refused to take the heavy German seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. Go ahead and do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do what?&rdquo; Bausch&rsquo;s eyes goggled at the editor suspiciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do what you came to do. Make your demand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You make a formal demand on behalf of the Deutscher Club for a retraction
      of my editorial?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Declined, with the editor&rsquo;s thanks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bausch&rsquo;s neck showed signs of swelling beyond the confines of his
      collar. &ldquo;You refuse to accebd the rebre-sentations of this commiddee?&rdquo; he
      inquired, with a thickening accent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know. Let&rsquo;s hear &rsquo;em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The chairman produced from the official pocket a document which he
      proceeded to render vocally. It was quite grave and awful in verbiage, and
      there was a great deal of it, rising through a spiral of whereas-es to a
      climax of denunciation. At the conclusion the editor held out his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You want this?&rdquo; queried Mr. Bausch doubtfully. &ldquo;What for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For to-morrow&rsquo;s paper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wish to publish it? Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A glint appeared in Jeremy&rsquo;s eye. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so prettily worded,&rdquo; he explained
      with sweet simplicity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bausch turned the characterization over in his heavy mind. &ldquo;Pretty,&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;<i>Pretty?</i> I do not think&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s making a fool of you, Mr. Chairman,&rdquo; broke in Engel, a little, neat,
      nervous man. He turned on Jeremy. &ldquo;You insult our club and now you insult
      us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Apropos of insults,&rdquo; retorted Jeremy: &ldquo;what about this document that Mr.
      Bausch has just read so expressively? Murder seems to be about the only
      thing that is n&rsquo;t charged in it. Would you call that a testimonial of
      regard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Consider the provocation,&rdquo; said Blasius. &ldquo;Be square about this thing, Mr.
      Robson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me a chance,&rdquo; returned the editor promptly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t begin by holding
      a gun to my head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The case is blain,&rdquo; stated Bausch in his heavy accents. &ldquo;You cannot deny
      the editorial charching that we made a festivity over the Lusitania.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Evidently not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We demand a retragtion of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On what ground?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because it was an outrache on a high-toned, representative organization,
      a private&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was n&rsquo;t it true?&rdquo; Andrew Galpin&rsquo;s sharp-edged voice injected a new and
      brisker element.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh?&rdquo; The interrogation seemed to have been jolted out of Chairman
      Bausch&rsquo;s volume from somewhere below the Adam&rsquo;s apple.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was n&rsquo;t it true that there was a dinner at the club to celebrate the
      Lusitania?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is not the question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the only question,&rdquo; put in Jeremy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You refuse to apologize&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For commenting on fact? Certainly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;While we &rsquo;re on the subject,&rdquo; pursued Galpin, &ldquo;is n&rsquo;t it true that
      Professor Brender, of Old Central, came in when the dinner was half over,
      and gave you all hell for pulling such a rotten stunt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gott im Himmel!&rdquo; muttered Blasius. He turned to Bausch. &ldquo;Is that true?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That he said his heart was all for Germany, and that if submarine warfare
      was necessary to her success it must go on; but that the man who rejoiced
      over its necessary tragedies was a reckless fool who put every decent
      German-American in a false light? Isn&rsquo;t that true?&rdquo; continued the
      relentless voice of Galpin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going to prind that?&rdquo; muttered Bausch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A newspaper does n&rsquo;t print everything it hears. If we could have verified
      it, we&rsquo;d have printed it, at the time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall come back to the point,&rdquo; said the chairman, recovering himself.
      &ldquo;The Guardian editorial is an affront to a respected and valuable element
      of the community.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t respect child-and-women murderers,&rdquo; flashed Jeremy, &ldquo;nor those
      who honor them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It all comes to this, Mr. Robson.&rdquo; This was Blasius. &ldquo;Is your paper for
      or against Germany in this war?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Guardian is neutral.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neutral!&rdquo; snorted Bausch. &ldquo;A straddler.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that editorial neutral?&rdquo; demanded Engel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not neutral as regards piracy,&rdquo; answered its writer steadily. &ldquo;Neutral as
      regards legitimate warfare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of which you are the jutch,&rdquo; sneered Bausch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So far as my paper is concerned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bausch returned doggedly to the charge. &ldquo;The Deutscher Club is a private
      organization of gentlemen. For what goes on within its doors we are not
      resbonsible to any outsider. The Guardian has traduced and defamed us&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sounds like an action for libel,&rdquo; interpolated Galpin. &ldquo;Who drew that up:
      Judge Dana?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again the chairman gulped in unpleasant surprise. But he recovered and
      continued: &ldquo;&mdash;and in the name of the club we demand a full and
      fitting apology&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold on!&rdquo; cried Jeremy. &ldquo;It was a retraction just now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Retragtion or apology,&rdquo; amended the baited chairman. &ldquo;It is all the
      same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite different. A retraction admits an untruth. An apology merely says
      we&rsquo;re sorry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess either will do,&rdquo; muttered Engel uncertainly, perceiving that
      matters were not improving by discussion. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll leave it to you which.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy stood up significantly. &ldquo;Neither,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other two committeemen led out their chairman whose Adam&rsquo;s apple,
      though pumping furiously, was missing fire so far as vocal result was
      concerned. Their excited interchange of views died away in the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;ve invited Old Miss Trouble in to tea this time, sure,&rdquo;
       observed Galpin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t tell <i>me</i> about the Brender outbreak, Andy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were away at the time and had enough troubles, anyway. We could n&rsquo;t
      get it in any such shape that I dared print it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would n&rsquo;t Brender talk?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tried him. Tight like a clam. Murray, who was assigned to tackle him,
      said he looked like a man who had lost something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His country, maybe,&rdquo; surmised Jeremy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay-ah. I would n&rsquo;t wonder. I tell you, Boss, there&rsquo;s a type of
      German-American that is going through hell and out the other end before
      this thing is over. Me, I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;m not one!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather be that kind than belong to the Bausch species, though. Let&rsquo;s
      start a Back-to-Germany movement in The Guardian, Andy, and nominate
      Bausch for the first departure. Would n&rsquo;t that qualify us for the Suicide
      Club!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t trouble yourself, Boss. The Dutchers will save us the trouble of
      suicide, if they can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And on the following day, he bore the news of the first attack to his
      chief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boss, prepare! The blow has fell!&rdquo; he proclaimed tragically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s been denouncing us now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Worse. We&rsquo;re excommunicated. The Deutscher Club has expelled the paper
      from its sacred precincts. Out we go, lock, stock, and barrel: bell, book,
      and candle. Two whole copies lost to circulation at one swoop.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mild, Andy, mild! Verrall&rsquo;s got a list of thirty-seven quits by this
      morning&rsquo;s mail. He&rsquo;ll die of heart-failure superinduced by bad circulation
      if you and I don&rsquo;t stop running this paper into the ground.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Verrall&rsquo;s an earnest soul,&rdquo; observed the general manager, &ldquo;but he&rsquo;s
      always on the borderland of hysteria, and if an advertiser looks cross at
      him, over he flops.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. He had an &lsquo;attack&rsquo; this morning. Blasius is out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Entirely?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five inches double; three times a week. Gone glimmering into the jaws of
      Hun ruthlessness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any one else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Threats of reduced space. If only they dared, Andy, what would n&rsquo;t they
      do to us! But they need us in their business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Confirmation in part of Verrall&rsquo;s dismal forebodings came from Arthur
      Betts, of Kelter &amp; Betts, who dropped in to see Jeremy. Since the
      first struggle with the Retailers&rsquo; Association, Betts had proved himself a
      &ldquo;good sport,&rdquo; as he would have wished to have it put, in admitting The
      Guardian&rsquo;s right to editorial independence, which did not in any measure
      inhibit him from trying to &ldquo;put one over&rdquo; on the paper whenever he thought
      that he saw a chance. That was part of the game. Though usually worsted,
      he sometimes succeeded in landing a bit of free advertising. But, like a
      sound opponent, he had become a strong partisan of Jeremy as against the
      field.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You sure put it to the German lot in that editorial,&rdquo; he observed with a
      shining eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They had it coming to them,&rdquo; returned Jeremy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right! But they&rsquo;re sore clean through. Any cancellations?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blasius.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yep. He&rsquo;s a dachshund all right. Do you know what they&rsquo;re stirring up in
      the Retailers&rsquo; Association?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is rank treason and betrayal of secrets and so on; but they&rsquo;re
      talking down your circulation. Are you losing much?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough for &rsquo;em to demand a lower rate?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They can demand. They won&rsquo;t get it. We&rsquo;ve got a comfortable margin left.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, of course I&rsquo;m for it, officially. Here&rsquo;s another point. Some of our
      customers are beginning to talk to the salespeople and department heads
      about The Guardian. &lsquo;Do you advertise in that paper? What do you do that
      for? It&rsquo;s no good. Waste of money. I would n&rsquo;t believe a thing I read in
      it, not even an ad.&rsquo; You know the line of stuff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy did know it and knew how dangerous it was. &ldquo;Who are they?&rdquo; he
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hans, Fritz, and Wilhelm,&rdquo; grinned the other. &ldquo;They are n&rsquo;t scaring us.
      But you may get a kick-back from some of the other stores that are timider
      than we are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll keep an eye out, Betts,&rdquo; said the editor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the anti-Guardian campaign simmered, bearing testimony to a steady
      fire and a slow boiling beneath the surface. Said Judge Selden Dana to
      Montrose Clark: &ldquo;Our young cub of The Guardian is getting in wronger every
      day. I think a polite call is about due.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER V
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">D</span>EUTSCHTUM moves
      slowly, because it moves methodically. No general and open manifestation
      against The Guardian had followed the Lusitania editorial. None retaliated
      for the attack on the &ldquo;Surrender Bill.&rdquo; But, little by little, there
      became apparent a guerrilla warfare upon the paper. Manufacturers of
      certain products widely circulated in the State, particularly beers and
      soft drinks, began to withdraw or decrease their advertising. In every
      instance it was noteworthy that these concerns bore German names.
      Furthermore, small and casual advertisers of Teutonic cast of name and
      mind&mdash;For Sale, Want Ads, and the general line of &ldquo;classified&rdquo;&mdash;switched
      from The Guardian to the more amenable Record.
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite all this The Guardian made a clear and pretty profit in the busy
      year of 1915. Ups and downs marked the course of its circulation, but the
      general tendency was upward. The Retailers&rsquo; Association had given over any
      hopes of a successful drive against its advertising rates. Indeed, the
      best they could look for was that there would not be another increase.
      Success, however, had entailed special expenses. A new press had been
      installed. The working force was increased. An active and discontented
      element in the press-room, led by Milliken, had compelled an expensive
      readjustment of the wage scale, and the combative Socialist was already
      lining up his men for another raid. Thus Jeremy had found it expedient to
      renew from time to time the twenty-thousand-dollar note at the Drovers&rsquo;
      Bank. No difficulties had been made over the renewals. Nor was the owner
      of the paper much concerned with the matter. From the time that his
      property-had turned Prosperity Corner into Easy Street, to adopt Andrew
      Galpin&rsquo;s term, Jeremy had been content to leave the business and financial
      details to the general manager and Verrall, reserving himself for
      editorial problems. Even Verrall, of the twittering nervous system, was
      now ready to admit that the paper was winning and would soon be an
      established property, if Jeremy would tactfully refrain from further and
      gratuitous depredations against Teutonic sensibilities. Verrall did not
      appreciate, to the full, the unforgiving tenacity of Deutschtum.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately for Jeremy Robson, the campaign for the State offices of
      Centralia, in the fall of 1915, took precedence over everything else in
      the public mind. The reelection of Governor Embree on the anti-corporation
      issue was all but conceded. But it was not the issue that insured him
      victory. The solid German vote did that. Orders had gone forth to the
      German-language press that Governor Embree, even where special conditions
      made it impracticable to support him, must be recognized as an authority
      on international complications and a statesman of national caliber. For
      Embree&rsquo;s reelection meant that he would be next in line for the Senate
      vacancy, three years hence, and Deutschtum needed sympathetic souls, such
      as it deemed Martin Embree to be, in the high places of government. The
      real fight of the old-line crowd was for control of the State Legislature.
      For this they were quite ready to sacrifice their gubernatorial candidate,
      one Tellersen, a stock war-horse of the political stables. A safe
      representation in either legislative house would mean that Embree&rsquo;s pet
      corporation measure, aimed specially at the P.-U. and its branches, but
      affecting all railroads in the State, was scotched. It might even mean
      that the Blanket Franchise Bill could be put through. As a further
      safeguard to corporate interests, the P.-U. intended to put forward,
      later, its own legal adviser for a place on the Court of Appeals bench.
    </p>
    <p>
      The campaign drew the Governor and Jeremy Robson closer together than they
      had been since the Lusitania editorial. Where no vital matter of principle
      was involved, The Guardian was quite willing to keep off German toes. On
      his side, the campaigning Governor consented to emphasize Americanism
      while still maintaining his attitude of sympathy for the sentiments of the
      German-Americans. Embree won by a large majority, the German districts
      giving him a preponderance of votes which gravely troubled Jeremy when the
      figures were analyzed. But on the legislative side it was conceded that
      only the brilliant campaign of The Guardian in Fenchester and The Journal
      in Bellair had averted a signal defeat. Widespread &ldquo;trading&rdquo; of the
      German-American vote had favored the P.-U. plans. So close was the result
      that, when the figures were all in, no man could say which side had won.
      Taking both houses together there were at least ten indeterminate votes.
      Plainly the battle for control of the State would be fought out in the
      spring session between the corporation interests, locally represented by
      Montrose Clark and Judge Selden Dana, and the radicals led by Governor
      Embree. Through that winter Jeremy, scenting the lesser battle from afar,
      cried &ldquo;Ha-ha!&rdquo; editorially with frequency and fervor, relegating the
      greater cause to the background for the time. Herein he was honest enough,
      as well as politic. He believed that the action and course of the United
      States was in abeyance until the people should have opportunity of making
      themselves heard in the presidential decision of the coming year. Hence he
      was content to wait, always providing that no major issue imperatively
      called for an expression of policy. For a time, too, Germany seemed more
      inclined to respect the dictates of humanity. Locally, Jeremy found the
      atmosphere clearing. The Governor&rsquo;s triumphant reëlection had pleased and
      appeased the Germans, and they were inclined to accord a certain measure
      of credit to The Guardian. Jeremy was sensible of an improved temper in
      many members of the Deutscher Club as he met them casually. But Blasius
      was still out of the paper; Stock-muller as well. And Emil Bausch, when he
      encountered Jeremy on the street, became absorbed in the contemplation of
      the Beautiful as exemplified in cloud-shapes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Virtuously unconscious of any backsliding or suspicion thereof, Jeremy was
      surprised at being made the target of a direct attack by Miss Letitia
      Pritchard, whom he was passing with a bow on Bank Street one March day of
      1916, when she held him up with a lowered umbrella.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Robson, have you gone over?&rdquo; she inquired, her eyes snapping fire
      into the query.
    </p>
    <p>
      Naturally, Jeremy asked what she meant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been taking The Guardian again ever since the Lusitania editorial,
      because I just had to have an American newspaper in the house. Are you
      still that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you doubt it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could anybody help but doubt it!&rdquo; challenged the vigorous lady.
      &ldquo;Politics, politics, politics! Nothing but stupid politics! Don&rsquo;t you know
      the greatest war in history is coming closer to us every day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope not closer to us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A fool&rsquo;s hope! Do you know your Bible, Mr. Robson?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not as well as I ought.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better read it more. Those writers were n&rsquo;t afraid to speak their minds
      in a good cause.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the ugly adjective Jeremy flushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s beside the matter,&rdquo; she pursued, twinkling at him suddenly. &ldquo;I
      came across a quotation that the Deutscher Club ought to send you,
      suitably illuminated. Isaiah, 14, 8; the last sentence. Look it up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will,&rdquo; promised the editor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you can come and tell me how well it fits,&rdquo; she threw back at him
      over her departing shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Important telegrams claimed Jeremy&rsquo;s attention on his return. Having
      disposed of them, his mind reverted to Miss Pritchard&rsquo;s suggestion for a
      Deutscher Club quotation for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Buddy,&rdquo; he said to the industrious Mr. Higman, &ldquo;look up the fourteenth
      chapter of Isaiah, copy the last sentence of the eighth verse and bring it
      to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Protesting under his breath that this was no time for Sunday-School
      exercises, Buddy interrupted the composition of a Social Jotting, and set
      about the errand. When he returned there was a pleased expression upon his
      face. He presented his chief with a slip of paper thus inscribed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since thou art laid down, no feller is come up against us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this, Buddy?&rdquo; demanded the chief sternly. &ldquo;I said the Bible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s where I got it,&rdquo; returned the appreciative Buddy. &ldquo;Some of those
      old guys could sure sling the up-to-date stuff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bring me the Old Testament.&rdquo; Jeremy looked up the text and, to his
      surprise, verified the exact words. But when he saw the context he
      laughed. And that evening he made one of his rare calls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isaiah is no prophet so far as The Guardian is concerned,&rdquo; he declared to
      Miss Pritchard. &ldquo;And the style of that sting rings familiar. Where did you
      get it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was written on the margin of an old Guardian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy raised questioning eyes to her face. Miss Pritchard nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;She was back in Berne when that was sent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right?&rdquo; Jeremy was conscious that his voice was less <i>insouciant</i>
      than he could have wished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite. She will go back to Germany after the war, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you give her a message for me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you wish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dry, slightly hesitant tone meant, &ldquo;If you <i>will</i> be so foolish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell her for The Guardian,&rdquo; said Jem, &ldquo;that this feller has n&rsquo;t laid
      down. Tell her that he won&rsquo;t lay down&rdquo;&mdash;he paused, and then completed
      the paraphrase&mdash;&ldquo;though Hell from beneath is moved for him to meet
      him at his coming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put that on your editorial page,&rdquo; said Miss Pritchard, with a thrill in
      her voice. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like Marcia to see it there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I will when the day comes,&rdquo; he answered and took his leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the first message that he had sent to Marcia Ames since they had
      parted at the door of the Pritchard mansion nearly four years before.
      Every sense of her, every thought of her, was as vivid, unblurred,
      untainted by time as if she had gone from him yesterday: &ldquo;the loveliness
      that wanes not, the Love that ne&rsquo;er can wane.&rdquo; Now, even by so tenuous a
      thread as his impersonal message for The Guardian, he held to her again.
      And in his heart sang something lesser but sweeter than hope.

      CHAPTER VI
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>ORDS occasionally
      take epidemic form. Such was the course of the word &ldquo;hyphen&rdquo; through the
      United States in the year 1916, with its alternate phases, &ldquo;hyphenate&rdquo; and
      &ldquo;hyphenated.&rdquo; Centralia, however, established a quarantine against the
      terms. They were checked at the borders of the State. Where they did creep
      in and break out into print, it was but a sporadic appearance, the
      references being both cautious and resentful that such a characterization
      should be allowed to the license of an unbridled Eastern press. None was
      willing to admit that the hyphen could be an issue in the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      It fell to The Guardian to make the first use of &ldquo;hyphenate&rdquo; as a term
      carrying a suggestion of reproach. Quite casually, indeed carelessly, it
      was written in a sentence of no special import in one of Jeremy&rsquo;s
      editorials. Where bolder and more direct offense might have passed with no
      more than the usual retaliation, this by-word was seized upon by the
      enemy. It came in the more pat in that, since Jeremy&rsquo;s talk with Miss
      Pritchard, The Guardian had assumed a more positive tone upon war issues.
      Now the hyphenated press again fell upon him tooth and nail. The
      Marlittstown Herold und Zeitung sounded the keynote in declaring that The
      Guardian, not content with playing England&rsquo;s game and misrepresenting
      Germany&rsquo;s part in the war, had now descended to calling the loyal
      German-Americans foul names. &ldquo;Hyphenate&rdquo; did n&rsquo;t seem to Jeremy a very
      villainously foul name. He was much inclined to dismiss the whole thing
      from mind as a petty excuse for renewed hostilities, had not the flood of
      letters in his mail apprised him that the chance word had been salt upon
      the raw surfaces of the Teutonic skin. Selecting a typical letter, he
      replied to it in a moderate and good-tempered editorial, pointing out that
      in the hyphen itself was no harm; but that essentially the Nation had a
      right to expect every German-American, Irish-American, Swedish-American,
      or other adoptive citizen, to consider the interests of this country as
      paramount in any crisis. Far from soothing the exacerbated press, this
      seemed rather to inflame them. Their principles were not clear (other than
      that they were not to be &ldquo;dictated to&rdquo; by Jeremy or any one else), but
      their temper was. That one misstep had landed The Guardian in a hornet&rsquo;s
      nest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just about the time when the buzzing and whirring were the loudest, Judge
      Selden Dana called to see Jeremy, and requested the favor of half an
      hour&rsquo;s uninterrupted conference upon a subject of importance. When the
      long-jawed, sleepy-eyed, crafty-spoken lawyer settled down to his topic,
      it manifested itself as the imminent fight in the Legislature over the
      public utilities bills. On behalf of certain clients, Judge Dana would be
      pleased to know what attitude The Guardian might be expected to assume.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you read The Guardian, Judge?&rdquo; inquired its editor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Always. I may add, carefully.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then do you have to ask where we stand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Circumstances change, Mr. Robson. Conditions also. Sometimes opinions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Changed circumstances or conditions might alter The Guardian&rsquo;s opinions.
      Is that the idea?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose that The Guardian&rsquo;s circumstances are changed,&rdquo; murmured the
      lawyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy&rsquo;s easy smile vanished. &ldquo;The Guardian is able to take care of
      itself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Up to a point. That I will concede. But, all things considered, would not
      the paper do well to make some friends now, instead of enemies?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That depends on the price to be paid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Small. Ridiculously small.&rdquo; Judge Dana spread out a pair of candid hands.
      &ldquo;Mr. Robson, I&rsquo;m not going to ask that The Guardian oppose the Corporation
      Control Bill when it comes up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor that you&rsquo;ll support the Blanket Franchise Bill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I appreciate your forbearance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But The Guardian has professed a profound regard for neutrality.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As to the war only.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neutrality,&rdquo; repeated the lawyer, &ldquo;as to the war. Whether you have
      practiced what you preach is another matter. Some of our most influential
      citizens and business men&mdash;<i>and</i> business men&mdash;appear to
      think not. I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he continued with intent, &ldquo;whether The
      Guardian&rsquo;s note for a considerable amount&mdash;say, well, twenty thousand
      dollars&mdash;would be considered safe today by the best of our local
      banks. I say, I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s very little you don&rsquo;t know, isn&rsquo;t there, Judge?&rdquo; retorted the
      editor evenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I try to keep informed; I try to keep informed.&rdquo; The long jaw relaxed a
      trifle. &ldquo;Now, Mr. Robson, a reasonable neutrality as to these pending
      measures would be greatly appreciated by us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Appreciation is a vague sort of thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re going to trap me, young man,&rdquo; warned the visitor
      keenly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not here to make offers. Every man may have his price, but I
      don&rsquo;t happen to be fool enough to think that I know yours or could pay it
      if I did. I want to appeal to your sense of fairness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy laughed, not unpleasantly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t scare me, Judge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. This is plain talk. The P.-U. intends to open up soon its extensive
      educational campaign of advertising, to instruct the public on these new
      issues.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Through the newspapers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Through the newspapers. Would The Guardian refuse that advertising?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see any reason why it should.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good. Would it accept the advertising and take our money in payment
      for value received, and then turn about and destroy all the value to us by
      attacking our arguments editorially?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very ingenious,&rdquo; smiled Jeremy. &ldquo;But we&rsquo;ve been over that before, have
      n&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not ingenious. Simple fairness. Is n&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s quite plain that we can&rsquo;t take your ads. In other words, Judge
      Dana, you can&rsquo;t buy our editorial opinions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See, now, how you divert my meaning,&rdquo; reproached the lawyer. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
      distinctly said that all we expected in The Guardian is neutrality.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t buy our silence, either,&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;ll you take for The Guardian?&rdquo; asked the lawyer abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Guardian&rsquo;s not for sale.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be before the year&rsquo;s end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As a prophet you don&rsquo;t qualify, Judge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As a man who knows what is going on, I do. Figure out what the loss of
      the P.-U. advertising will cost you; the present advertising and the
      coming campaign. Figure on top of that the other railroad advertising
      affected by this strike bill of Embree&rsquo;s. Add what you&rsquo;re losing every day
      by your war-policy. Then figure out where you&rsquo;re going to get your next
      loan. After that, come and see me. Delighted to have you call at any time.
      Good-bye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, I wonder how much of that is bluff,&rdquo; Jeremy communed with himself,
      after his caller had left.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not long to wonder. The P.-U. contract was cancelled on the
      following day: a sure sixteen hundred dollars and a potential twenty-five
      hundred dollars a year. On top of that every railroad company advertising
      in The Guardian gave notice of withdrawal.
    </p>
    <p>
      At least four thousand dollars more, gone. True, Jeremy might have brought
      suit, but the contracts were so loosely drawn that the issue would have
      been doubtful. As if by a preconcerted signal, various concerns in Bellair
      and the other large cities, which had been consistent patrons of The
      Guardian for years, dropped out. One chum manufacturing company was quite
      frank as to the reason. So much criticism had poured in from the German
      farmers, against The Guardian and any one supporting it, that the concern
      deemed it wise to remove the cause of offense. Jeremy pondered upon the
      probability that the P.-U., represented for political reasons in the
      Deutscher Club by Judge Dana, was working with the hyphenate element to
      down the paper. He foresaw that he would need all his resources, editorial
      and financial, to weather the storm. No hope, for the present, of paying
      off that twenty-thou-sand-dollar note at the Drovers&rsquo; Bank. Upon the heels
      of the thought, he recalled Dana&rsquo;s innuendo.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went at once to the bank and asked for the president, Mr. Warrington.
      Mr. Warrington was gently regretful, but could not see his way to renew
      the note. No, not even for half the amount. Money was in great demand.
      Newspaper security was proverbially unstable. Finally: &ldquo;One of our
      directors who is in a position to be informed strongly advises against
      continuing the loan.&rdquo; Knowing beforehand what name he should find, Jeremy
      looked up a list of the directors. There it was, &ldquo;Montrose Clark,
      President Fenchester Public Utilities Corporation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pride, an excellent quality in an editor, is no asset to a borrower.
      Swallowing his, Jeremy made a pilgrimage of mortification to the offices
      of the P.-U. Corporation, where he presented to Garson, the hand-perfected
      secretary, his application to see Mr. Montrose Clark. Garson, discreetly
      and condescendingly smiling from above the carnation in his curvy black
      coat, said that he would see if it could be arranged. Thereafter Jeremy
      had leisure to do more swallowing, for he was kept waiting a humiliating
      and purposeful hour. Admitted, at length, to the presence, he went at once
      to the point.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Clark, it is going to be very inconvenient not to have The Guardian
      note renewed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The president of the P.-U. was no foe to time-saving directness. &ldquo;It would
      be very inconvenient for us to have The Guardian misrepresenting the new
      franchise plan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not a franchise. It&rsquo;s a Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company charter. It would
      give you the right to do anything from conducting a revival to raising
      beans on the right of way. It is n&rsquo;t even constitutional.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lesser legal authorities than yourself venture to dissent,&rdquo; returned the
      other, sardonically. &ldquo;Such as Judge Dana.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s paid to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you are paid for your partisanship, in circulation among
      sensation-seekers, and in the favors of that blatherskite, Embree.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Guardian stands by the Governor in this fight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go to him for your loan, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I to understand that unless I play the corporation game here, the
      banks are closed to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not from anything I have said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Said</i>: no. It&rsquo;s pretty plain what you mean. Well, the plant is good
      security. I can get money from the Chicago banks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably not,&rdquo; was the quiet retort.
    </p>
    <p>
      It fell upon Jeremy&rsquo;s consciousness, with chill foreboding, that this
      might be true. Little though he knew of banking, he guessed that any
      large, out-of-town banks would take counsel of the local institutions
      before making a loan. What information would thus be elicited would hardly
      be favorable. He rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Mr. Clark. If you &lsquo;re going to fight that way, it can&rsquo;t be
      helped. The Guardian is n&rsquo;t going to back down. We&rsquo;ll fight you on your
      own terms, to a finish.&rdquo; The red face of the local great man grew redder.
      &ldquo;With this difference, that we&rsquo;ll fight fair.&rdquo; The face turned purple. &ldquo;I
      bid you good-day, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean by talking to me about fairness?&rdquo; burst out the other.
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what fairness is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call it patriotism, then. If I were in your position, Mr. Clark, I don&rsquo;t
      think I&rsquo;d care to make a deal with the Deutscher Club committee, to try
      and ruin a newspaper for daring to be American and not hyphen-American.&rdquo;
       Montrose Clark bolted up out of his chair. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lie,&rdquo; he roared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the truth. Ask Judge Dana. You&rsquo;re going to put him up for the Court
      of Appeals, I hear. Let me suggest that you read his record first. Or, you
      can read it later in The Guardian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you threaten your betters, sir.&rdquo; Jeremy laughed. &ldquo;Let me tell you
      before you go,&rdquo; pursued the exacerbated banker, &ldquo;that I have n&rsquo;t forgotten
      your impertinence in pretending to expect me to trot around to your
      wretched little newspaper office.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Instead of annoying, this final flash of pettiness rather cheered Jeremy.
      After all, he reflected, on his way back, a man so small-souled could not
      be a very formidable opponent. Montrose Clark, he surmised, was powerful
      chiefly because nobody had ever boldly challenged his power. Nevertheless,
      Jeremy did not under-reckon the seriousness of his situation. Money the
      paper must have, and at once. By gutting his reserve and selling some
      high-grade stocks in an unfavorable market, he could pay off the note.
      But, in that case, The Guardian would have to continue on a shoe-string,
      and with obvious troubles looming ahead. He laid the problem in conference
      before Andrew Galpin and Max Verrall. Verrall, who for weeks had been
      prowling about the office with his pale and bony fingers plunged in his
      brickish hair, ready at any moment, one might infer, to pluck out some
      desperate handfuls, promptly made the same suggestion that Montrose Clark
      had proffered, though in a different tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go to the Governor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How would he have any spare money?&rdquo; demanded Galpin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He can get it easy enough. His name on a note would go with any bank in
      the Northern Tier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. That won&rsquo;t do,&rdquo; objected Jeremy. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re too close politically. That
      would compromise The Guardian if it were ever known.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him fix it up for you, then, without his endorsement,&rdquo; insisted the
      other. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go up and see him now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arrangements were quickly completed. Nothing easier, the Governor had
      said, smiling. He had sent Verrall up to Spencerville with letters. All
      was concluded that evening. The Spencerville Agricultural Savings Bank
      would be glad to loan to Mr. Robson, on the security of The Guardian
      plant, any sum up to twenty-five thousand dollars. Verrall brought back
      the glad news in the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too easy,&rdquo; grumbled Galpin. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t close yet,&rdquo; he advised his chief
      privately. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m taking a day off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The general manager made a flying trip to Spencerville. On his return, he
      held a long conference with Jeremy, the upshot of which was that the
      Governor was warmly thanked for his kind offices, but informed that the
      loan would not be needed as another arrangement had been made. The other
      arrangement was a second-mortgage loan on the building for fifteen
      thousand dollars. This, they hoped, would pull them through.
    </p>
    <p>
      Andrew Galpin had won his point by a silent exhibit of a snap-shot taken
      in Spencerville. It showed the obliging bank, with its front window
      bearing this inscription:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Landwirtschaftliche Spar-Bank.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lettering was German text.

      CHAPTER VII
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>IGHTY was the
      clash of political lances, that spring of 1916, in Fenchester. Senate and
      Assembly alike rang with noble phrases and high sentiments. The mortal
      agony of a world across the seas, locked in a conflict which should
      determine the future of civilization, became a quite unimportant matter to
      those embattled souls on the hill. Let outer and lesser history take its
      course; it was theirs to decide whether the State of Centralia should or
      should not thenceforth emancipate itself from the rule of its former and
      uncrowned dictators. From the front pages of the local press, a committee
      vote was likely to evict an Italian battle, or an interview with Montrose
      Clark or &lsquo;Governor Embree take precedence over a peace-hint from Baron
      Burian. All of which meant, if you read The Record, that the radical and
      socialistic element were undertaking to slay the fairy-babe, Blanket
      Franchise, and substitute the horrid changeling, Corporation Control;
      whereas, if you pinned your faith to The Guardian, it indicated the final
      struggle of an oppressed people to writhe out from beneath the heel of a
      conscienceless, tyranny of dollars. Amidst all this sound and fury Judge
      Selden Dana&rsquo;s candidacy, signifying much but saying little, was pressed.
      Only one reference had the Judge made to Jeremy&rsquo;s warning about his past
      record.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remember that libel is criminal as well as civil, my young friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To which Jeremy replied cheerfully: &ldquo;Let us know when your formal
      announcement is made, Judge. We&rsquo;ll give you a good show.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Agreed,&rdquo; said the lawyer. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll give you some advertising, too. I&rsquo;ve
      got to convert some of your deluded followers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Already the advertising campaign of the P.-U. was in full swing. Part of
      it had been offered to The Guardian, in spite of Judge Dana&rsquo;s earlier
      threat. That had been partly bluff. The astute politician knew that an
      element, not otherwise attainable, could be reached with argument through
      the radical paper. Only with great difficulty had he persuaded Montrose
      Clark to this view. Said the public utilitarian, reluctantly according his
      assent: &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t forgotten that that cub accused us of playing the
      Germans against his paper. I gave him the lie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Judge Dana, who knew far more about the Deutscher Club&rsquo;s internal
      operations than he cared to have his principal realize, passed this
      observation with a non-committal smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to advertise my own candidacy there,&rdquo; he pursued. &ldquo;To get
      converts you&rsquo;ve got to go after the other side.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After having prevailed upon the public utilitarian to adopt his view,
      Judge Dana was chagrined at having the proffered advertisements rejected
      by the owner of The Guardian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why?&rdquo; he demanded, his sleepy eyes lifted to Jeremy&rsquo;s with a candid
      and injured expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You want too much. I remember your learned and able argument as to
      editorial forbearance toward advertisers, Brother Dana.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lawyer shifted his ground. &ldquo;Is it fair to deny the other side a
      hearing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;ve got me,&rdquo; admitted Jeremy. &ldquo;It is n&rsquo;t. But if I take
      your ads and then go after you editorially, you&rsquo;ll claim that we are
      double-crossing you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In fact this is precisely what the ingenious Dana had purposed doing,
      through the lips of his campaign speakers. But he came back promptly with
      &ldquo;The ads are offered without stipulations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy considered. Setting aside the money consideration, the mere
      appearance of the P.-U. advertising in The Guardian would notably add to
      the paper&rsquo;s prestige, as an admission that its advertising pull was
      essential even to a hostile campaign. He very much wanted that
      advertising. Picking up a pencil he scribbled a sentence, conned it,
      amended, elided, copied it fair and full and handed it across to the
      other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Provided that every ad carries this footnote,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Judge Dana read. &ldquo;You young hellion!&rdquo; he murmured, and grinned aslant and
      ruefully. He repeated the words on the paper. &ldquo;This paid advertising is
      submitted and accepted without reference to what may appear upon the
      subject in the news or advertising columns of The Guardian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, is n&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; asked Jeremy, in the tone of innocence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You young hellion!&rdquo; said the Judge again, almost affectionately, this
      time. His double-cross accusation was gone glimmering. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go you,
      anyway,&rdquo; he decided. &ldquo;Do you want the same footnote on my campaign stuff?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. That&rsquo;ll speak for itself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let it speak fair. That&rsquo;s all I ask. And see here, young man. Twenty
      years ago is n&rsquo;t a fair basis to judge a man on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is, if the man has n&rsquo;t changed,&rdquo; Jeremy shot back.
    </p>
    <p>
      At what was judged to be the psychological moment, the news was permitted
      to seep into the papers of the State that the eminent jurist Judge Selden
      Dana was being urged to become a candidate for the vacancy on the Court of
      Appeals bench. The method was sedate almost to demureness. Immediately
      there blossomed forth fragrant and colorful editorials, from all corners
      of the State to form a wreath for the blushing and débutante candidacy.
      These constituted an enthusiastic and determined public demand. Judge Dana
      urbanely announced that he would accede to it. The Guardian carried the
      announcement as news, giving it due prominence. Thereafter, for several
      days, Judge Dana, Montrose Clark, and a number of other important and
      interested persons, secured early editions of The Guardian each day with
      more interest than they would have cared to admit. When the attack did
      come, it was in such peculiar and indeterminate form that there was a
      general sigh of relief over a venture foredoomed to fall flat.
    </p>
    <p>
      On his editorial page, Jeremy had &ldquo;boxed&rdquo; a double-column at the top, with
      what was obviously the outline of a half-tone photographic rectangle. But
      the interior was a blank. Below it ran the legend:
    </p>
    <p>
      A CANDIDATE ( Fill in the Picture to Suit Yourself)
    </p>
    <p>
      This was followed by one of the most biting poems from the grimmest volume
      of modern American literature, with the attributive line:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From Edgar Lee Masters &lsquo;Spoon River Anthology&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      I was attorney for the Q.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And the Indemnity Company which insured
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      The owners of the mine.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      I pulled the wires with judge and jury
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And the upper courts, to beat the claims
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Of the crippled, the widow and orphan,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And made a fortune thereat.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      The bar association sang my praises
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      In a high-flown resolution
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And the floral tributes were many&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      But the rats devoured my heart
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And a snake made a nest in my skull!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Deeming this a flash-in-the-pan, the Dana partisans reckoned without the
      terrible power of allusiveness. Ugly memories rose to meet, identify, and
      confirm the portrait. Day after day, Jeremy reprinted it, without comment.
      The press in other places took it up, and in an unbelievably brief time it
      had spread throughout the State, a strangleweed upon the growth of the
      candidate&rsquo;s tender young chances. Conferences were hastily called. Ways
      and means of curbing The Guardian&rsquo;s destructive activities were projected,
      canvassed, and dismissed. Apparently there was no way either of &ldquo;handling&rdquo;
       Jeremy Robson, or of uprooting a poem once planted and spreading in the
      public consciousness. The candidate himself, depressed but philosophical,
      pointed the way out. A substitute, stodgy but honorable, was found, and
      the regrettable but timely return of an ancient liver trouble compelled
      Judge Dana to withdraw from the exigent demands of a political campaign to
      the seclusion of certain reconstructive hot springs.
    </p>
    <p>
      What effect this might have upon the legislative fight, no man could
      foretell. Many thought that the Judge&rsquo;s candidacy had, in itself, impugned
      the P.-U. before the public. Certainly the leaders of the Blanket
      Franchise movement missed his shrewd judgment, for he would never have let
      them make the first move in a losing fight. In his absence Montrose Clark
      forced the issue. Embree&rsquo;s forces lined up against him, and beat the
      Franchise Bill in the Assembly by a round dozen of votes. Encouraged by
      this, the other side thrust forward Governor Embree&rsquo;s Corporation Control
      Bill as revised by Professor Rappelje. Now it was time for the public
      utilities of the State to rally to the last man, for this was a battle to
      the death. The Guardian did yeoman work in this as in the first action;
      but the weight of resources was on the other side. On the final vote the
      public utility interests won by a scant but triumphant margin of three.
      Thus the whole campaign had resulted in a draw. If Centralia had, on the
      one hand, repudiated corporation control, on the other it had balked at
      the radical measure put forth by the Governor. All that ground must be
      fought over again. The one clear triumph had fallen to The Guardian, in
      the ousting of Judge Dana.
    </p>
    <p>
      How the Judge would take his enforced temporary exile was a speculation
      which sprang into Jeremy Robson&rsquo;s mind when, the smoke of the corporation
      battle having cleared away, he met the shrewd jurist, brown, hearty, and
      with no slightest liverish symptom, in the hotel restaurant. Would he
      ignore Jeremy&rsquo;s existence? The younger man gave him credit for being too
      sound a sport for that. But he rather expected to be held at a distance.
      Not at all. Dana came up and shook hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glad to see you looking so well, Judge,&rdquo; said Jeremy, and meant it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Liver is n&rsquo;t much if you take it in time,&rdquo; returned the other gravely.
      Then, &ldquo;You still wield quite a lively pen, my young friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As a weapon of defense, it&rsquo;s useful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look out that the point does n&rsquo;t turn in on you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Warning or threat, Judge?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Professional advice. Something I seldom give gratis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bear it in mind. No ill-will, Judge?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I can take as well as give,&rdquo; answered Dana, who prided himself on
      never admitting and never forgetting an injury. &ldquo;This is no kid-glove
      game. But I would n&rsquo;t have thought poetry had such a punch in politics.
      I&rsquo;ll have to look into that line a little closer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As an example of what the Judge could give in return for what he took,
      there presently descended upon The Guardian a small but lively swarm of
      libel suits. All were traceable, directly or inferentially, to the office
      of Dana &amp; Dana, a firm which did not ordinarily cater to this class of
      business. Four were wholly without merit; two were of the kind that can
      always be settled for a hundred dollars and counsel fees, and the
      remaining one hinged upon an unfortunate and ambiguous sentence in the
      tax-dodging charge against that aged but vigorous lady, Madam Taylor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold-ups, pure and simple,&rdquo; said Andrew Galpin indignantly. &ldquo;Dana has
      drummed them up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you trace them to him? Safely enough so that we can print it?&rdquo; asked
      his chief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Print a libel suit against ourselves!&rdquo; said the general manager,
      scandalized at this threat against one of the most rock-ribbed principles
      of a tradition-choked calling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All seven of &rsquo;em. Tying each one up to Dana. No comment. The
      public will supply that for themselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The result more than justified the experiment. Dana &amp; Dana, who had
      not considered the possibility of this simple <i>riposte</i>, hastily
      withdrew the four weakest suits, amidst no little public amusement. The
      other three, however, were pressed, causing a continual wear-and-tear of
      worry and expense, which was their object. Every charge against The
      Guardian&rsquo;s exchequer now meant less fighting power later when the test
      should come.
    </p>
    <p>
      Politics succeeded politics in Centralia, meantime. Hardly was the
      legislative campaign over when the presidential election began to loom.
      Herein Jeremy found fresh source of difficulty and indecision. By training
      and natural affiliation he was opposed to the party of the President. In
      so far as The Guardian was committed at all, it was Republican in national
      politics, and more Republican than anything else in State. Undoubtedly the
      popular thing to do would be to enter upon a virulent attack against all
      the presidential policies. Embree urged this. It would go far to
      reconstitute the paper with the German-Americans who had already
      instituted the nation-wide campaign of the hyphen in favor of the
      President&rsquo;s opponent, taken by them on trust, as nothing was known of him
      in a world-political sense other than that he was a sturdy and fearless
      type of American. Possibly it was the very vehemence of the hyphenates
      that impelled Jeremy to a cool-headed course. Virulent he could not be;
      there was no venom in him. His first formal pronouncement upon the
      campaign was to the effect that the United States had never before had a
      choice between two alternative candidates of such high character and
      attainment; and this he heartily believed. The Guardian would support
      Hughes. But it served notice on all and sundry that it would be no party
      to rancorous, unjust, and un-American attacks upon a President whose path
      had been more beset with difficulties and perils than any leader&rsquo;s since
      the day of Lincoln. In a State so violently preoccupied with political
      prejudices as Centralia, this course was regarded as weak. It lost support
      to The Guardian.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout the ensuing campaign, Jeremy never seemed able to get his hands
      free from politics sufficiently to take up and develop a distinct attitude
      toward the deepening, threatening problems of the war. Embree deemed this
      fortunate. So did Galpin, upon whom the financial weight of the burden of
      conduct was heavily pressing. The fewer superfluous enmities The Guardian
      now stirred up, the better, to his way of thinking. Verrall was all for
      peace at any political price. But though the World-War was relegated to a
      place of secondary importance, in the main, it was not consciously
      neglected or belittled. Slowly there had grown up in The Guardian&rsquo;s
      environment the feeling that, after all, here was the one paper which was
      honestly undertaking to present the news as it developed. This helped to
      hold its circulation, even among those who bitterly resented its editorial
      attitude on the submarine, the bombing of defenseless cities, and similar
      war enterprises. So the paper won through the summer and fall of 1916,
      losing but little under the secret unremitting pressure of Deutschtum.
      When the President was reëlected, Jeremy Robson spoke out frankly and
      clearly the mind that was in him, calling for a united nation to be ready
      for what events might come upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Back at the base of Jeremy&rsquo;s hard-thinking brain there lay a lurking
      self-accusation. Had he not used the political stress as a convenient
      alibi? Had The Guardian truly stood on guard against the subtle and
      powerful inner war being waged across the hyphen? What of the promise,
      deadly serious despite its quaint Isaian twist, given to Marcia Ames? He
      sensed the looming conflict. He shrank from the terms of fulfillment to be
      exacted from him. But take up his pledge he must, when the hour came,
      though Hell from beneath were moved for him to meet him at his coming.

      CHAPTER VIII
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">D</span>UMBA had gone. Von
      Bernstorff was preparing for departure. The atmosphere which they had
      created under the cloak of diplomatic privilege was malodorous with the
      taint of plottings, corruption, and chicanery. Grain elevators were
      developing extraordinary tendencies toward spontaneous combustion.
      Munitions plants were dissolving into fiery fragments, in numbers beyond
      the reckoning of insurance-risk experts. Strikes were materializing in the
      most unexpected places and for the most unexplained reasons. An informal
      morning call upon a peaceful and businessless &ldquo;advertising agency&rdquo; office
      in lower New York had laid bare to the heads of Government the extent of
      Germany&rsquo;s official treachery, and inklings of it were beginning to leak
      out to the public. Strident politicians were filling the atmosphere with
      irresponsible clamor. The American representatives of Deutschtum were
      frantically explaining, denying, palliating, sulking, or plotting. No
      corner of the horizon but bristled with imminent lightnings. The earth
      underfoot trembled with the rumble of coming events. So the old year of
      1916 which saw civilization fighting with its back to the wall, the great
      bubble of Russian might and Russian nationalism already dissipating,
      France staggering though still resolute, England facing terror and herself
      the more terrible in that grim confrontation, the lesser nations opponent
      to Germany crushed to a mere welter of blood, the Hun savagely certain of
      his triumph, and on this side of the ocean, the United States being
      slowly, steadily, unwittingly, powerfully drawn and bound by the gossamer
      threads of a nation&rsquo;s psychology to the great purposes before it&mdash;so
      1916 passed into 1917.
    </p>
    <p>
      With it passed United States Senator Eugene Harter, of the State of
      Centralia. Time was when Senator Harter had been a useful figure in the
      Senate, rather by the possession of a vote than for any other and more
      forceful reason. But even his vote had been lost of late, for the
      exigencies of war-complications had terrified him and a nervous and
      overfed stomach had opportunely collapsed. The Senator fled to the tropics
      for surcease from troublous national questions and in search of health,
      and there encountered a mosquito in search of dinner. The mosquito being
      infected with one of the regional fevers, his victim passed, six weeks
      later, to that country where politics have been unknown since Lucifer&rsquo;s
      insurgents met their historical downfall. Thus was left as heritage to the
      Senator&rsquo;s already sufficiently bemuddled State a legacy of further
      complications, in that his successor must be elected in the early fall.
      Here was benign Fate moving to meet the welcoming smile of Martin Embree,
      well ahead of schedule. As soon as official decency permitted, he
      announced his candidacy for the senatorship. With his German following
      nothing, he believed, could defeat him. The path of glory extended, broad
      and unobstructed, before his eager feet to the Capitol at Washington; and
      thence&mdash;who could tell? His campaign prospered from the first.
    </p>
    <p>
      Imagination could picture nothing less like a lion in Martin Embree&rsquo;s path
      of progress than the old man who, on a harsh March night of 1917, sat in a
      scholar&rsquo;s book-lined study, painfully writing. A bust of Goethe looked
      benignly down upon him. There were pictures on the walls of Schiller, of
      Lessing, of Beethoven, of Wagner, and the table was strewn with German
      publications. By every bond of the old man&rsquo;s lonely life, he should have
      been at the Deutscher Club, for good news of the great war had come
      through private channels, and the <i>brüdern</i> were meeting that evening
      to celebrate, in good German drink, and hearty German song, and sturdy
      German sentiment, the promised triumph. Though an American since early
      boyhood, Professor George Brender had grown old in these associations. He
      was a lover of sound Rhenish wine and of the noble literature of the
      mighty German poets, and of that tenderest and loveliest and simplest of
      all music, the <i>Lieder</i> of the Fatherland, and above all, of the
      close comradeship of the German-American clan. Tonight he was giving them
      all up. He had been forced to the sternest decision of his life. Quite
      simply he wished that he might have died before his seventieth year had
      set a sword in his hand wherewith he must now sever himself from past
      loyalties and fellowships. It amounted to that. For, torn to small
      fragments in his waste-basket, was a letter upon which he had pondered for
      a week; a letter from another German-American, a man wise and informed and
      clear of vision and of spirit, and that letter summoned him, in the name
      of a lifelong friendship, now to declare himself. From the first reading,
      he had known how the decision must fall. The Germany of world-domination,
      of the &ldquo;will to victory,&rdquo; of the torn and dishonored &ldquo;scrap of paper,&rdquo; of
      terrorism and the slaughter of the helpless, and violation of humanity&rsquo;s
      laws&mdash;that was not his Germany. To it he owed no real allegiance. As
      between it and his adoptive country he could no longer hesitate. He was an
      American. And as the first step toward justifying himself to his own soul,
      George Brender, Doctor of many degrees from Universities German and
      American, head of the German Department of Old Central, feared of its
      undergraduates for his caustic tongue, loved of its graduates for his leal
      and generous heart, had resigned from the Deutscher Club of Fenches-ter,
      with all that the action implies.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gravest events of the cumulative international crisis did not more
      deeply stir Fenchester than the resignation of Professor Brender. Of such
      import to us human toads are the giant ripples upon the tiny puddles
      wherein we mightily splash! Rumors of the most violent and inspiring
      nature were passing from mouth to mouth before his letter was formally
      announced but verification of his intent had been wanting. Neither local
      paper had touched it, therefore. So the story grew and took on strange
      embellishments. Professor Brender had torn down the German flag from over
      the Deutscher Club door and resigned rather than be expelled. Professor
      Brender had called upon the Deutscher Club to rise and sing the
      &ldquo;Star-Spangled Banner,&rdquo; and had resigned in fury when they refused.
      Professor Brender had denounced the Club as traitors and been thrown out
      bodily by President Bausch. Professor Brender was going to sue the
      Deutscher Club. The Deutscher Club was going to sue Professor Brender.
      Gossip, untrammeled by the responsible restraints of print, was having a
      gala day over the affair. Yet all that the old German scholar had done was
      to resign, on the ground that his sympathies must henceforth be American
      and not German.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now he sat in his study, sorrowful and lonely, seeking to stem the tide of
      rumor by a plain statement to the press. He wrote in German, for thus his
      deeper feelings best expressed themselves, then translated into simple and
      gracious English. This is the letter of Professor George Brender, as
      offered to and refused (for reasons of policy) by The Record, but
      published conspicuously by The Guardian:
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>I have grown old and gray in the service of the German tongue and
      German letters in America. One of the most vivid recollections of my
      childhood is the positive declaration of the German elders that I was not
      a German but an</i> Amerikaner. <i>On the other hand, the Americans were
      just as emphatic in their declaration that I was a German. Then the
      &ldquo;hyphen&rdquo; came to the rescue and I blossomed out into a German-American
      with a</i> dicken Bind-estrich <i>(thick hyphen). Later I heard that the
      Kaiser had given it as his opinion that there were only Germans and
      Americans. The true Americans of my own country endorsed this point of
      view. So I concluded that I would have to make a place in the sun for
      myself. </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, with the snow gathering on my hair, I am an American only:
      nothing more (if there be such) and surely nothing less.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my American heart there is and always will be a shrine dedicated to
      that which came into my life from the soul of my father and mother. But
      they have long ago gone into the land from which no traveler returns and
      they have left a son who can love but one flag, although he has often
      nailed the Star-Spangled Banner to a staff of good solid German oak.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am now an old man, whose work is almost done. I cherish but one more
      great hope&mdash;that on the stars and stripes of my country&rsquo;s flag there
      shall ultimately be written the gospel which will redeem the world&mdash;the
      fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had finished reading that letter, Jeremy Robson dropped his head
      between his doubled fists and lost himself in thought. It was not pleasant
      thought. Self-reproach was a burning element in it. Here was a man
      German-born, German-bred, German by every tie of life except the
      profounder bonds of conscience and patriotism, saying to the
      German-Americans of Centralia, in no uncertain tones, that which he, the
      editor of The Guardian, had had in mind to say&mdash;when the time should
      come. And, behold, the time had come! Any hour in which a man great of
      soul and clear of vision to meet the issue would speak out, was the
      appointed hour. He, Jeremy Robson, despite all his good intentions and
      brave promises, had procrastinated and paltered and dallied, while
      another, with far more to lose, had lifted the banner and set it up for a
      challenge to the disloyal, the unloyal, and the half-loyal. A sorry enough
      champion Jeremy Robson seemed in his own eyes! Doubt of his own courage,
      smothered under the pressing emergencies of the past few months, lifted up
      a strident and whimpering voice. And that was a doubt with which young Mr.
      Robson could not live on any terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the threat of war had loomed, with the dismissal of the German
      Ambassador, The Guardian had broached the project of a State Council of
      Defense in a plain-spoken but moderate editorial. Further, it had urged it
      upon the Governor who, with unaccustomed vacillation, had evaded and
      procrastinated, arguing that the time was not yet ripe, and that the plan
      would needlessly complicate matters. Naturally the more rabid German press
      fell foul of it with their accustomed shrillness. Rather than embarrass
      Embree at the time, Jeremy had refrained from following up his first
      editorial, but had pressed the scheme upon the Governor by private
      persuasions. Now, in the stir caused by Dr. Brender&rsquo;s call to the flag, he
      would bring it out again. If necessary he would force it upon Embree, who
      could not well withstand a direct challenge to his patriotism. He sketched
      out three leaders on the topic; then put them aside and wrote the opening
      sentence of that editorial which was to declare unequivocally the status
      of The Guardian. Thus to declare was to declare war.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The hyphen has two ends but no middle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mild to the verge of banality, in wording. Yet the writer well appreciated
      the high-explosive potency of that aphorism. Even without what followed,
      it would be taken up as a defiance, the first open defiance since Magnus
      Laurens&rsquo;s speech, to the German-Americans of the State. It would be the
      first step toward putting them on record. No one knew better than the
      owner of The Guardian that upon the editor who should first demand of the
      Centralia hyphenates that they declare themselves as for or against the
      United States, who should assume the initial responsibility for making the
      polyglot Commonwealth a house divided against itself in treacherous and
      deadly enmities, the united and deliberate vengeance of Deutschtum would
      fall in every practicable form of reprisal. Sharp as was the offense he
      had heretofore given, it was upon issues of minor import as compared to
      this. This was final.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the emotions are deeply engaged, a practiced pen follows the thought
      of the writer almost without interruption. At the conclusion of his work,
      Jeremy read it over, altered a word or two, not in the way of modification
      as is the tendency of re-casting, but from weaker to stronger; then, after
      a moment&rsquo;s thought, resumed his pencil and with extreme care and neatness&mdash;as
      a young officer going into desperate action might meticulously brush and
      set his uniform&mdash;inscribed the caption, &ldquo;Under Which Flag?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He then did an unaccustomed thing. He made a complete tour of The Guardian
      plant. Why, he could not have said, at the time. Afterward he realized. It
      was the pride and satisfaction of proprietorship feeding itself. Beneath
      it lay the unvoiced monition, warning him that it might not be for long.
      Nevertheless, Jeremy was happy. He had been in a defensive fight for a
      weary length of time. Now, at last, he had hit out from the shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Transferred into typewriting at the hands (two-fingered at the exercise)
      of Mr. Burton Higman, the editorial had gone upstairs. It returned,
      galley-proof, in the hands of Nicholas Milliken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This yours?&rdquo; he asked of the editor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did n&rsquo;t carry any O.K. For to-day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Milliken lingered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Jeremy sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty hot stuff,&rdquo; observed the Socialist. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll start something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It probably will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somebody pulled a couple of extra proofs on me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somebody? Who?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dunno. Only I don&rsquo;t want to be held responsible if they get out of the
      office in advance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The proofs were already out of the office and on their way to the
      Deutscher Club, a fact concerning which Mr. Milliken probably had his
      shrewd suspicions, had he cared to voice them. But the hyphen editorial
      was not destined to burst upon the German-American world of Fenchester
      that day. For, at noon, Max Verrall entered the editor&rsquo;s den, his brisk
      eyes alight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did the Governor get you?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;State Council of Defense. He&rsquo;s going to put it through. I&rsquo;ve just seen
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good business!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better call him up. He&rsquo;ll tell you more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy did not get the Governor, but his private secretary verified
      Verrall&rsquo;s report. &ldquo;Yes. I&rsquo;ve been trying to get you. The preliminary
      conference is set for to-morrow at ten.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Short notice,&rdquo; said Jeremy, surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call&rsquo;s gone out over the wires. Will you come to the Capitol this evening
      to talk it over with the Governor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy assented. He imparted the good news to Andrew Galpin, whom he had
      sent for to run over the hyphen editorial. &ldquo;The State Council of Defense
      is going through, Andy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Smiling Mart&rsquo; has climbed off the fence, has he? Or did we push him
      off?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy frowned. &ldquo;Nobody pushes Martin Embree.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Boss,&rdquo; conceded the other good-humoredly. &ldquo;He can certainly
      push himself ably when the occasion arises. I reckon this is part of his
      push for the senator-ship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anyway, Andy, you&rsquo;ll admit that this State Council move proves where he
      stands on Americanism.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll admit that,&rdquo; said the cautious Galpin, &ldquo;when I see it&mdash;in The
      Guardian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be all right,&rdquo; said his supporter with conviction, &ldquo;now that the
      issue is getting clear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about your editorial, now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had n&rsquo;t that better wait a day or two? You don&rsquo;t want to muddy up the
      water unnecessarily. If the State Council move is on the level, your
      hyphen stuff will only make hard sledding for Embree.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, too. I&rsquo;ll put it on the hold-over hook.&rdquo; Arriving at the
      Executive Office at seven-thirty, Jeremy was conscious of effort in the
      Embreean smile, conscientiously directed upon him. That fine wave of the
      gubernatorial hair, too, so suggestive of uplift in its stressful rise
      from the broad, even forehead, seemed to droop a bit. Smiling Mart Embree
      looked like a man who has passed the night in a sleepless torment of the
      mind. &ldquo;Any late news on the wires?&rdquo; he asked anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little. All of one kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pointing toward war?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;War,&rdquo; said the editor gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There must be some way out!&rdquo; The Governor lost himself in a maze of
      thought. &ldquo;This is a terrible thing!&rdquo; he muttered bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was bound to come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A terrible thing,&rdquo; repeated Embree, &ldquo;for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For you?&rdquo; Jem stared, startled at the out-cropping of egotism.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For all of us,&rdquo; hastily amended the other. &ldquo;For the Nation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure. It may be that we needed it, to save us from ourselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is one to do? How is a man to tell what course he can safely take?&rdquo;
       said the Governor, pursuing his own line of thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is n&rsquo;t exactly a time for Safety First, is it? There&rsquo;s only one course
      for a decent American.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s so like you,&rdquo; fretted the other. &ldquo;You see your own side and
      nothing else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What else do you see?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see this great State of Centralia which has chosen me for its chief
      official,&rdquo; retorted Embree with a touch of that exaltation which, his
      enemies sneered, invariably crept into his speech when it dealt with his
      political self. &ldquo;I see it torn and racked from end to end, and aflame with
      hatreds, dissension, and distrust. I see all the long fight that I&rsquo;ve made&mdash;that
      we have made&mdash;against corporation control of the State gone for
      nothing in the new political issues. Have you thought of that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It does n&rsquo;t matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not matter!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not if we go to war. Nothing else matters then but ourselves and Germany.
      We&rsquo;ve got to think of the country as a whole and of ourselves just as a
      part of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m for the country!&rdquo; proclaimed Embree. &ldquo;Of course! But I&rsquo;m not for
      this war if it can be avoided.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not by any such hot-headed, reckless course as The Guardian is laying.
      You&rsquo;re doing everything but yell for war and the blood of your own
      neighbors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy&rsquo;s lip protruded obstinately. &ldquo;Is that the view you take of it?
      We&rsquo;ll do more to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, Jem! What has got into you? How can you commit yourself
      to such a policy of savagery?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is n&rsquo;t going to be a polite war, Martin. But if I&rsquo;m a savage, at
      least I&rsquo;ll be an American savage; not a German savage. That&rsquo;s all we&rsquo;re
      committed to in The Guardian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s too much. It is n&rsquo;t the time for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not when every national right has been violated?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forget your newspaper rhetoric and listen to common sense. Jem, will you
      be discreet for once in your editorial life?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I doubt it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is deadly serious. Listen: Congress is going to hear from the
      country. Appeals are going to be made&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which country?&rdquo; asked Jeremy with intent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Try to be reasonable about this,&rdquo; pleaded his friend. &ldquo;These appeals are
      going to pour in on Washington, to stop while there&rsquo;s time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More German propaganda. You&rsquo;ve answered my question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The demand of a peaceable people for peace,&rdquo; controverted the Governor
      heatedly. &ldquo;At the same time the newspapers all over the country will be
      urged to use their influence toward keeping us out of a war that can mean
      nothing but injury to their business. We&rsquo;ll show that blundering fool in
      Washington&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His visitor stiffened perceptibly in the chair. &ldquo;Are you speaking of the
      President of the United States?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, between four walls,&rdquo; Embree deprecated. &ldquo;Since when did you swing
      around to the Schoolmaster?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since he gave the word to close ranks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s never given it. His whole attitude is a big bluff. The only danger
      is that the hot-heads will make capital of it. He does n&rsquo;t intend to go
      through with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re wrong there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he does, he can&rsquo;t do it. Congress has the final word. And Congress is
      responsive to the newspapers. Now, Jem, when the arguments from the other
      side come to The Guardian&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re being swamped with &rsquo;em already; machine-made letters to the
      editor, fresh every hour from the Deutschtum factory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give them a fair show. Publish them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see them damned first!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neutrality!&rdquo; commented the Governor acidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;War!&rdquo; retorted the owner of The Guardian.
    </p>
    <p>
      With an obvious effort &ldquo;Smiling Mart&rdquo; summoned his beam from out the gloom
      and set it on guard again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When it comes to the pinch you&rsquo;ll find me as ready to fight as anybody,&rdquo;
       he asserted. &ldquo;The only difference between your position and mine is that I
      want to be perfectly sure it&rsquo;s right and inevitable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The State Council of Defense is a long step in the right direction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must n&rsquo;t be too long a step, though,&rdquo; the Governor pointed out. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
      defense, not offense, that&rsquo;s our purpose. By the way, do you know that
      there is an old act of the Legislature empowering the Governor to appoint
      such a body?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fine!&rdquo; said Jeremy heartily. &ldquo;Then you can do the whole business at
      to-morrow&rsquo;s meeting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but I thought it advisable to have the formal approval of a
      State-wide representative body, such as I&rsquo;ve called together, for the
      moral effect&mdash;and the political,&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve made it non-partisan?&rdquo; asked Jeremy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes! Of course! And representative; representative of all classes.
      To make it so I&rsquo;ve been obliged to include some of the German element.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. That&rsquo;s all right, as long as they are n&rsquo;t the &lsquo;Deutschland
      über Alles&rsquo; lot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some of them, I&rsquo;m afraid, don&rsquo;t like you much; or you them. Now, Jem,
      don&rsquo;t go off at half-cock,&rdquo; he added persuasively as the other looked up
      at him with a gleam of discomposure. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t ignore my best political
      friends and supporters, can I? And you know we have no sol-ider, more
      influential citizens than our Germans.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what about their loyalty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t expect too much of them right now. They&rsquo;ll be all right when the
      test comes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The editor thought it over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I get your point. If you go back on &rsquo;em now they&rsquo;ll slaughter
      you for the senatorship.&rdquo; In spite of himself, &ldquo;Smiling Mart&rdquo; Embree
      winced. &ldquo;Well, a few of &rsquo;em in the conference, or even on the
      council, can&rsquo;t do any harm; in fact, it may serve to bring &rsquo;em
      around, unless they&rsquo;re too far gone. A lot depends on whom you appoint
      chairman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your idea on that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Magnus Laurens.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why a corporation grafter?&rdquo; challenged the other, eyeing him narrowly;
      &ldquo;and one that&rsquo;s always fought us and may fight us again for the
      senatorship?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is n&rsquo;t a grafter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s an associate of grafters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if he has fought us, he&rsquo;s fought fair. Also, he&rsquo;s one hundred per
      cent American. That&rsquo;s the big consideration in this matter. But if you
      won&rsquo;t stand for him, how about Corliess, of the Lake Belt Line. Cassius
      Kimball vouches for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Governor Embree stared. &ldquo;First a water-power baron and then a
      public-utilities manipulator,&rdquo; he commented. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re chumming up with some
      queer friends, for a radical, Jem.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re no friends of mine,&rdquo; retorted the editor. &ldquo;You know that. But
      they&rsquo;re men we can trust to be right on this war question. However, any
      one will do, provided he&rsquo;s big enough, loyal to the bone, and
      representative.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave it to me, Jem,&rdquo; said the Governor with his warmest smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Returning to his den for the purpose of preparing an editorial boosting
      the new project as an accomplished fact, Jeremy saw a light in the
      business office. Amid ledgers and files of The Guardian sat Andy Galpin,
      figuring profusely upon sheets of paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Boss!&rdquo; was his greeting. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying to find out where we stand
      now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you make of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hard sledding; but we&rsquo;ll pull through. Always supposing that the dam&rsquo;
      Botches&rsquo;&mdash;thus, now, did the general manager at once anathematize and
      Americanize that element whose solidity and good citizenship all political
      parties so warmly and officially endorsed&mdash;&lsquo;don&rsquo;t lift too much of
      our advertising, in return for your few well-chosen remarks upon the
      hyphen. They&rsquo;ll be after us hot-foot, sure.&rdquo; After a pause he added:
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve been working on &lsquo;Smiling Mart.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has n&rsquo;t done them much good so far.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On Verrall, too. He&rsquo;s so far up in the air that his nose is turning blue.
      And something&rsquo;s up in the press-room. I think it&rsquo;s that big gorilla,
      Girdner. He&rsquo;s a Botch; belongs to their club. Milliken; he&rsquo;s another
      trouble-hunter. The Socialist. Wish I could pin something on him and fire
      him. Well, you&rsquo;ve got troubles enough without that. Sorry I spoke.... Have
      a pleasant evening with the Governor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pleasant enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hope the morning will be as good,&rdquo; retorted Galpin, and hunched himself
      back into his calculations.
    </p>

      CHAPTER IX
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE hyphen
      editorial spent the following morning on the hook. Its author gave it an
      affectionate and yearning glance as he passed early to his desk to touch
      up his substitute leader on the State Council of Defense. Once fully
      determined upon the casting of his verbal bomb, he was eager for the
      explosion and the resultant battle which should end the armed truce. But,
      as Andrew Galpin had said, fair play demanded that he hold off now, lest
      he hamper the development of the Governor&rsquo;s new plan. Any time was
      suitable for his challenge. Meanwhile copies of it from the stolen galleys
      had been circulated among the elect of Deutschtum, and a synopsis taken to
      Governor Embree. He had bidden his informants not to worry. There would be
      no occasion for the publication of that screed. A plan was already
      completed which would take care of Mr. Robson. It was observed that the
      Governor looked weary but optimistic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Short though the notice had been, the invited conferees responded to the
      official call for a meeting upon the State Council of Defense plan, almost
      unanimously. It was a curiously assorted gathering that surrounded the
      long table in the council room, when Jeremy Robson arrived, a trifle late
      from his work of re-casting the day&rsquo;s page. That it was broadly
      representative was beyond denial. Yet as the newcomer reckoned it up, he
      felt a more than vague uneasiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Appropriating the nearest vacant chair he found himself between a
      down-state lawyer and politician named Lerch on one side, and Cassius
      Kimball, of The Bellair Journal, on the other. Next to Kimball sat State
      Senator Bredle from Embree&rsquo;s county, beyond him a lake-district dairyman
      of indeterminate political sympathies, and then Gordon Fliess, of the
      Fliess Brewing Company, the Lieutenant-Governor, an imposing and
      obsequious puppet of the Governor&rsquo;s, and Ernst Bauer of the Marlittstown
      Herold und Zeitung. Bunched at the upper end of the table were an
      ill-assorted trio of The Guardian&rsquo;s enemies, Montrose Clark, Judge Dana,
      and that anomaly of Teutonic type-reversion, Robert Wanser, grandson of
      the Young Germany of &rsquo;48.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the other direction, the prospect was no less puzzling nor more
      reassuring. Half a dozen men from the Southern Tier, a section unfamiliar
      to Jeremy, suggested a predominance of the Swedish type, which, in
      Centralia, meant anti-war sentiment. Concerning the next figure, tall,
      plethoric, ceremonially garbed, there was at least no uncertainty. Emil
      Bausch&rsquo;s local letter-writing bureau of German propaganda was at that
      moment represented in The Guardian&rsquo;s waste-basket by half a dozen grossly
      pro-German and subtly anti-American communications to the editor. Bausch
      had for neighbor that fire-eating Seminarian, the Reverend Theo Gunst,
      next to whom, in turn, sat Arthur Betts, of Kelter &amp; Betts, looking
      uncomfortable but flattered. Milliken, presumptively representing the
      Socialist element, flanked him on the far side with Girdner, appearing for
      Labor, on his left.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when Jeremy&rsquo;s anxious glance finally reached the Governor&rsquo;s high chair
      he breathed a temporary sigh of relief. In the place of honor, on the
      right of the gubernatorial smile, sat Magnus Laurens. Surely that
      indicated an acceptance by Embree of Jeremy&rsquo;s argument; Laurens was to be
      appointed chairman of the council, after all. The Governor&rsquo;s left was
      occupied by Ensign, the millionaire absentee owner of The Record. In a
      less crowded moment Jeremy would have given some thought to this curious
      preferment. Directly across the table from the central group there
      protruded loftily from between a pursy judge and a northwestern
      corn-raiser, a figure tall, stiff, and meager, a lean, hard-wood lath of a
      man lost in the dim, untroubled contemplation of an awful example of
      political portraiture on the far wall. Why Professor Rappelje should have
      been included, Jeremy could not surmise, unless it was that Governor
      Embree could count upon him as an unquestioning follower through thick and
      thin. In fact the whole composition of the meeting suggested that the
      summons had been apportioned with a view to safe control by the Governor.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the watchful Jeremy it seemed that Governor Embree was nervous. The
      smile at the corners of the conciliatory lips was disturbed by a restless
      twitching. After an anxiously calculating glance over the assemblage he
      began to read from a typed sheet a preamble, concluding: &ldquo;Therefore, I
      present for the consideration of this honorable body the following names
      to constitute the Centralia State Council of Defense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The first nomination fell upon Jeremy&rsquo;s ears like a burst of thunder. It
      was that of Emil Bausch, chairman.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second nomination fell upon his brain like a bludgeon. It was that of
      Jeremy Robson, vice-chairman.
    </p>
    <p>
      From down the table he caught the confirmatory sneer of Montrose Clark.
      His eyes darted to Magnus Laurens, squarest and most honorable of enemies,
      and met in his face a wrathful contempt. Cassius Kimball leaned to him and
      whispered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First you knew of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s put it over on you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy sat in a daze. His mind was confused by the suddenness of the
      thrust; his will was blurred. Instinctively he felt that he must do
      something. But what? Protest? Decline to serve? Announce his attitude? And
      already his time was past! The monotonous, fateful reading had gone beyond
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wanser and Fliess, Kimball, Laurens, ex-Governor Scudder, Montrose Clark,
      the Reverend Theo Gunst, Lieutenant-Governor Maxwell, Ensign, Bredle,
      Girdner, Ivanson, the Swede, and so on with the German and pacifist
      element always slightly but safely in the majority. Not a word was spoken,
      except once when in a brief breathing-pause some one shot out, like an
      arrow through the tense quiet, the contemptuous monosyllable:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Packed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy thought that he identified the voice as that of Judge Selden Dana.
      Then the reader pronounced the name of Professor Harvey Rappelje.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; said that gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Order! Order!&rdquo; protested Wanser and Bausch with suspicious readiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am in order,&rdquo; retorted the economist, rising in his place to confront
      the Governor opposite.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Governor smiled, but thrust out a nervous tongue and licked the
      corners of the smile. The professor&rsquo;s face was as set and still as a
      frozen river, and much the same color. Embree, motioning with a placating
      hand for silence, resumed: &ldquo;The Honorable Carter N. Rock&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; The scholar&rsquo;s keener voice cut off the reading. &ldquo;I rise to a point
      of order, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;State the point.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Governor Embree, is that your honest conception of a council to fight
      this war?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out of order!&rdquo; cried Bausch again, and was reinforced by Girdner, Fliess,
      and others. &ldquo;Who said fight?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are not making war.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep to the point.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Discussion is not in order.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the hard challenge of the professor&rsquo;s glare compelled the Governor.
      &ldquo;It is my carefully considered selection,&rdquo; said he with a suggestion of
      sulkiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      There leapt from Rappelje&rsquo;s lips a blasting oath. From any mouth in that
      environment it would have been startling. From the lean dry, silent,
      repressed scholar it had something of the shock of nature&rsquo;s forces in
      outbreak. Not less appalling was the single word to follow:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Treason!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Embree&rsquo;s smile did not fade; but it shriveled into a masklike grimace, the
      rictus of a child before the convulsion racks it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&mdash;you will retract&mdash;&rdquo; he began chokingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two astounding tears welled from the scholar&rsquo;s pale eyes, tears of a still
      man&rsquo;s uttermost fury.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will demonstrate to you,&rdquo; said he precisely, &ldquo;what it is to fight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He launched himself across the table at the Governor&rsquo;s throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The steel-framed Laurens seized and forced him back; but not before Embree
      had collapsed into his chair. From his place, up the table, the
      Lieutenant-Governor, quite beside himself, squealed for a totally
      imaginary sergeant-at-arms. The corn-belt farmer, in thunderous tones with
      a wailing inflection besought any and all not to forget that they were
      gentlemen. Girdner, huge and formidable, had jumped to his feet. The
      white-haired, alert Milliken caught up a heavy paper-weight. Bausch was
      solemnly, almost sacrificially taking off his coat. A medley of voices
      demanded &ldquo;Order!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Throw him out!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arrest him!&rdquo; There were all the elements of a lively and scandalous
      mêlée, waiting only the fusing act.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laurens checked it with one sufficient threat. Brandishing the weighty
      official gavel of lignum vitæ, he stood, a modern Thor, in the unconscious
      pose and with the menace of the Berseker, and, in a full-throated bellow
      proclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll brain the first man that strikes a blow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before that intimidation they dropped into their chairs. There was a
      ripple of the shamed and foolish laughter of self-realization as the
      strain eased. The warrior-scholar&rsquo;s neighbors, who had been holding him in
      his chair, felt his limbs relax, and mistakenly thinking his effort spent,
      released him. Instantly he rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I apologize to this honorable body,&rdquo; he said with quiet courtesy, &ldquo;and to
      the State of Centralia as represented by its chief executive. And, as a
      question of privilege preliminary to my resignation, I ask whether the
      list as read is to stand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not submit to be bulldozed or intimidated,&rdquo; declared the Governor
      huskily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The list stands?&rdquo; persisted the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It stands, subject to the approval of this body.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doubtless you can carry it,&rdquo; conceded the objector, ranging the
      assemblage with his clear and contemptuous glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vote,&rdquo; piped up an uncertain and tentative voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you would be well advised not to make the attempt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Martin Embree conceived that the proper course now was to ignore this
      unforeseen assailant of his plan. &ldquo;I will proceed with the reading,&rdquo; he
      announced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; said the relentless and polite voice. &ldquo;One moment.
      You will have until this evening to withdraw your list.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And vot then? Vot then?&rdquo; broke in Emil Bausch, thrusting upward a
      truculent face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you want civil war in this State?&rdquo; challenged Fliess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If necessary,&rdquo; retorted Rappelje, and stared him down with a steady and
      intolerable eye. He turned again to the Governor. &ldquo;Unless that list is
      withdrawn before night, Martin Embree,&rdquo; said he solemnly, &ldquo;so help me the
      God of my country, I will raise the University and hang you to the highest
      tree on the campus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>

    <p>
      He made a stiff, formal, absurd little jerk of a bow and marched from the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By gosh! He&rsquo;s the boy could do it,&rdquo; confirmed Milliken in an
      unexpectedly cheerful chirp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Finish the reading,&rdquo; said somebody weakly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vote! Vote!&rdquo; came a mutter of several voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      No vote was taken. Under the corroding acid of the professor&rsquo;s passion the
      fabric of that meeting&rsquo;s purpose dissolved. The session did not adjourn.
      It disintegrated. Jeremy Robson stood irresolute as the groups edged past
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Congratulations, Mr. Vice-Chairman,&rdquo; purred Montrose Clark. It was the
      first time since the interview about the note that he had conceded the
      fact of the editor&rsquo;s existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bad politics, my boy! Bad politics!&rdquo; said Judge Dana, his head wagging
      with reprehension, but a malicious twinkle in his somnolent eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cassius Kimball set a friendly hand on Jeremy&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;Pretty shrewd
      of old Martin, eh?&rdquo; he observed. &ldquo;But we can square that, among us. Let me
      know what you want The Journal to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy nodded his gratitude, but did not move. Laurens was the man he
      wanted to see, to set himself right before. Moreover, with him as leader a
      counter-stroke could be planned to bring Embree to his senses. The viking
      form strode toward him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Laurens,&rdquo; began Jeremy, &ldquo;I want&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stand out of my way!&rdquo; warned the magnate, and swerving not an inch from
      his stride, he jostled the other aside. But for Kimball&rsquo;s quick
      interposition Jeremy&rsquo;s fury would have launched him upon the insulter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Steady!&rdquo; soothed that experienced diplomat. &ldquo;You come outside with me,
      and cool off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Jeremy, mastering himself. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to wait. I&rsquo;ve got to see
      the Governor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But has he got to see you?&rdquo; inquired the other suggestively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has,&rdquo; said Jeremy with grim positiveness. Governor Embree had closeted
      himself with Wanser, Bausch, and Fliess. He sent out word that he would
      see Mr. Robson in half an hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy telephoned to Andrew Galpin to hold the editorial page make-up
      open. He strolled to the window and got an unpleasant shock. Montrose
      Clark, Judge Dana, and Nicholas Milliken were standing in earnest
      conference, near one of the park benches. The Socialist, the public
      utilitarian grafter, and the legal manipulator! It came back to Jeremy&rsquo;s
      mind that, according to Galpin, there was a leak of information from The
      Guardian office to the Fenchester Public Utilities Corporation. Milliken
      was perhaps the go-between, unlikely though such an association might
      seem, at first thought. He would speak to Galpin about it. Meantime he had
      another editorial to outline, and set about it, seated at the table across
      which the first real action of the war in Centralia had just been fought
      to an indeterminate result.
    </p>
    <p>
      A buzz of guttural voices inside the door interrupted him. Glancing at the
      clock he was astonished to see that it marked twenty minutes of one. The
      half-hour had grown into more than an hour. An inner door opened and the
      waiting man heard Smiling Mart Embree&rsquo;s weary but clear-toned &ldquo;That can
      wait, gentlemen.&rdquo; The Germans passed Jeremy, Wanser giving him a civil
      word and Bausch nodding sardonically, as one might to a none-too-welcome
      accomplice by compulsion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in, Jem,&rdquo; summoned the Governor, and the editor of The Guardian
      advanced to confront his longtime friend, aide, and ally.
    </p>

      CHAPTER X
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>DMIRATION was
      Jeremy&rsquo;s first impulse as he faced
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin Embree. The man had so quickly and surely recovered his poise.
      Serenity was in his tired smile, and the assurance that from Jeremy he
      would have understanding and sympathy. To destroy that childlike and
      beaming confidence was a thing smacking of brutality. Jeremy fought off a
      temptation to temporize and went to the point at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you appoint me vice-chairman without consulting me in advance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Governor&rsquo;s smile became both confident and confiding. &ldquo;Because you&rsquo;re
      the man for the place. We need you there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or because you thought it would tie my hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tie your hands?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep The Guardian quiet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Guardian has to keep quiet, anyway. It&rsquo;s the only course open to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it?&rdquo; said Jeremy significantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is n&rsquo;t it? Reason it out for yourself. Either we&rsquo;re going to get into
      this war or we&rsquo;re going to keep out of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to get into it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it. But admit that we are. Until we&rsquo;re in it, it&rsquo;s our
      business, those of us who have influence, to use it in keeping peace at
      home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;While the Germans at home work out Germany&rsquo;s plans.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bosh! Germany&rsquo;s real plans are to keep this nation at peace. She does n&rsquo;t
      want us in the war. And we certainly don&rsquo;t want to get in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. We don&rsquo;t want to. But we&rsquo;re being forced to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait until the real underlying public sentiment asserts itself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s asserting itself now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, Jem. Jingoism always makes the loud noise. But jingoism is n&rsquo;t
      Americanism. The one thing America won&rsquo;t do is to go into a losing war.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can make it a winning war.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it were truly our war, we could. But the people are n&rsquo;t for it. They
      never will be for it. Now look at the situation in this State, in the
      light of what is coming in Europe. Germany is sure to win. This State
      splits about even now between German sympathizers and the others
      represented by the pro-British and those who don&rsquo;t really know where they
      do stand. Only, the Germans have got the solidarity and the others are
      divided.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right in that, anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. After Germany has won, it&rsquo;ll be all pro-German here. That&rsquo;s
      our American way of it. We&rsquo;re all for success. Then where will a newspaper
      be that has taken the losing side?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you see, Martin, that we&rsquo;re practically in the war now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jingo talk! If the capitalist crowd could drive us into it we&rsquo;d be in
      now. It&rsquo;s the duty of good Americans, and particularly of every American
      newspaper, to stand solid against it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that the principle on which you appointed your State Council of
      Defense?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it is! I&rsquo;ve drafted a body of men who can be trusted not to
      rush us madly into this damnable mess. That&rsquo;s our real, our best possible
      defense&mdash;to keep at peace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very pretty sophistry! How far do you think it would go with a real
      American? Harvey Rappelje, for instance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Governor&rsquo;s eager face darkened. &ldquo;That crazy fool!&rdquo; he blurted out.
      &ldquo;Who could have foreseen that he&rsquo;d break over!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He did what each of us ought to have done in his turn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say that, Jem!&rdquo; implored the other. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m about beside myself over
      this Rappelje business now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Afraid?&rdquo; Jeremy looked at him curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of his mad-dog threat? No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet the boys at Old Central would follow him in anything. Curious that
      such a type should take hold on the youngsters&rsquo; imagination, isn&rsquo;t it?
      It&rsquo;s the fire at the heart of him, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The maggot in his brain!&rdquo; returned the other fiercely. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s crazy enough
      to try his mob scheme.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he tries, he&rsquo;ll carry it through.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Against a company of the National Guard?&rdquo; said the official
      contemptuously. &ldquo;I could have them here in ten minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would mean bloodshed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s what I dread. Some of those young idiots might be killed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And their ghosts rise up between you and the senatorship,&rdquo; pointed out
      Jeremy. &ldquo;If the charge of official murder were raised against you, it
      would kill your chances. Rappelje may have figured that out, though I
      would n&rsquo;t suppose he&rsquo;d be so keen in politics.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Black shadows of brooding settled upon Embree&rsquo;s handsome face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll arrest that frantic fool of a professor,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll arrest
      him now. Nobody can call me a traitor!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy made up his mind, and struck:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t they? Read to-night&rsquo;s Guardian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;T-t-to-night&rsquo;s&mdash;Wh-wh-what!&rdquo; stuttered Embree. &ldquo;Jem! You&rsquo;re not
      going back on me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Going back on you! Have n&rsquo;t you gone back on me? Have n&rsquo;t you gone back
      on the State? On the country? Did n&rsquo;t you pledge yourself to appoint a
      representative American Council of Defense? Where did you get your list?
      By cable from Berlin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you trying to do? Provoke a fight?&rdquo; retorted the other fiercely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make you wipe out that council of Germans.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t be bulldozed and blackmailed!&rdquo; shouted Embree in the loud wrath
      of a weak man cornered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s the lynching party and the end of you politically. We&rsquo;ll have
      an interview with Rappelje in this evening&rsquo;s paper. He&rsquo;ll talk. That
      silent kind always do, once they break over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Governor collapsed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; he pleaded. &ldquo;Give me time to think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He walked to the window and stared out toward the east&mdash;his Mecca&mdash;Washington.
      When he turned, his face was so haggard that Jeremy felt a stab of
      remorse; but Embree contrived to summon the fleeting wraith of that once
      bounteous smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got me,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make another list. Wait while I
      outline it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I&rsquo;ve got to go to the office.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come back here in an hour, then. I&rsquo;ll have it ready.&rdquo; The hour Jeremy put
      in in outlining to Galpin and Verrall the probable new course of the
      paper. Galpin was grimly pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew we&rsquo;d have to quit him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the end of the paper,&rdquo; prophesied Verrall, pale and shaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      Governor Embree was almost his normal self with almost his normal smile,
      when Jeremy returned to the Capitol. His revised list was one which needed
      no defense. It was preponderantly American, though with many of the
      prominent German names left, it is true, and the addition of Professor
      Brender and another loyal German-American. Magnus Laurens had been
      substituted for Bausch as chairman. Jeremy&rsquo;s name remained as
      vice-chairman. &ldquo;Is that good enough?&rdquo; asked the Governor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. That&rsquo;s a real Council of Defense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then The Guardian will stand for it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the finish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Smiling Mart Embree swallowed hard and beamed anxiously upon the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo; The negative was bluntly final.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God, Jem! What more could you ask?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A leader who can be trusted to be American.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is the parting of the ways, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The finish.&rdquo; Something in Jeremy&rsquo;s throat was hurting him so that he
      could hardly speak. And he could not, for anything, look at Martin Embree.
      Then Embree made it easier for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And after all the years I&rsquo;ve stood by you!&rdquo; he cried angrily. &ldquo;You
      turncoat! You don&rsquo;t know what loyalty is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got pretty definite notions as to disloyalty.&rdquo; Embree seized a pen
      and crossed Jeremy&rsquo;s name off the revised list, with a pen that ripped
      through the paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said the victim evenly. &ldquo;Who goes in as vice-chairman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s for me to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re still expecting The Guardian to support the council?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Embree&rsquo;s throat contracted with impotent fury. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll put in Clarence
      Ensign.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An impulse of pity rose within the other. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t do anything with The
      Record crowd, Martin,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;How can they play your game? I don&rsquo;t
      suppose you&rsquo;re going back on your corporation policies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not. But you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a bit of it. We&rsquo;ll be with you on that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With me, after you&rsquo;ve stuck a knife in me!&rdquo; The conviction of having
      suffered unmerited wrong, ever at call in an egoist&rsquo;s soul, surged to
      Embree&rsquo;s pale lips. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve sold out to the corporation gang. That&rsquo;s what
      you&rsquo;ve done,&rdquo; he accused. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve sold me out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The bitter and withered face of the man who had been his friend oppressed
      Jeremy with a sense of tragedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, Mart,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry it&mdash;it had to be this way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have cause. You&rsquo;ll be sorrier.&rdquo; The smile was a little crooked now,
      with a hint of fangs at the corner. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a poor forgetter, Robson.
      Particularly when it&rsquo;s my friends who betray me,&rdquo; he added, calling out
      the last words after the departing visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      So there was no interview with Professor Rappelje in that evening&rsquo;s paper.
      Nor did any account of the vivacious proceedings of the conference appear.
      These the editor of The Guardian deemed to be confidential. Nevertheless,
      there was no dearth of interesting matter in that issue. The announcement
      of the State Council of Defense personnel stirred up hearty approval among
      a large element and grievous surprise and wrath in other quarters. Further
      to enrage the aggrieved Germans, The Guardian&rsquo;s clear challenge, &ldquo;Under
      Which Flag?&rdquo; retrieved at the last moment from the hook and double-leaded
      for emphasis, set the two ends of the hyphen to bristling mutually, and
      surcharged the air with more electricity than it could comfortably
      contain.
    </p>
    <p>
      In its next issue, The Guardian sprang another sensation by formally
      forswearing its support of Governor Embree. Its leader for the day, under
      the heading &ldquo;He Who is Not For Us is Against Us,&rdquo; established a local and
      definitive test of Americanism, and declared all other questions and
      issues subordinate to the critical interests of the Nation as a whole. The
      Guardian would remain steadfast to the internal policies and reforms which
      Governor Embree had instituted. It could not and would not support him
      for the United States Senate, believing, as it must, that to elect him
      would be to place a putative enemy agent in that body.
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin Embree answered through the columns of The Record. The slanderous
      assertions of The Guardian, he stated, would later be cited for proof
      before the courts. The Record gave him two mildly supporting editorials,
      but did nothing to indicate an alliance. Thus Embree was forced to enter
      the crucial campaign of his political career without local editorial
      support. At the same time The Bellair Journal quit him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The greater necessity that he should keep himself before the public in the
      news. His projected libel suit against The Guardian would be one method.
      After considerable delay the suit was filed.
    </p>
    <p>
      But here again the unlucky politician missed fire. Nobody paid much heed
      to his libel action. For, on the day when it was instituted, the patience
      of a long-enduring President and people broke and the Government of the
      United States of America bared the sword between the flag and its
      insulters overseas.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>OW essential a
      prop Martin Embree&rsquo;s influence had been to the threatened fortunes of The
      Guardian, its editor was now to learn. Where, hitherto, the paper had
      offended, &ldquo;Smiling Mart&rdquo; had palliated, explained, excused, defended,
      spreading the soothing oil of his diplomacy with expert healing. Now the
      bland oil was supplanted by salt to rub into the wounds. At this, too, the
      Governor plied a master-hand. The &ldquo;firebrand&rdquo; interview, given to the
      papers of the State, in which he solemnly and all but officially
      anathematized The Guardian as an incendiary and anarchical agency, rallied
      the forces of peace-at-any-price and helped to organize them for the ruin
      of The Guardian. This was in the interval between the establishment of the
      State Council of Defense and the declaration of war, a period when
      Centralia still blundered about in a fog of delusion, blindly discrediting
      the inevitable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vainly a few dailies strove to force the truth upon them; The Bellair
      Journal, The Guardian, a handful of lesser papers. It was to be read
      between the lines of the German-language press, exhorting their people to
      be firm of spirit and stand together whatever might betide, warning them
      that British agencies were in control of the Administration, openly
      flouting and vilifying the Government of the Nation at a time when
      politicians of all parties but the Kaiser&rsquo;s had forgotten every
      consideration but loyalty, extolling and exalting Germany, snarling at the
      military &ldquo;pretensions&rdquo; of the United States, appealing to racial divisions
      in a last-hour attempt to devitalize the war-spirit. But the Centralians,
      breathing the murky air of their pacifists&rsquo; paradise, were in no mood to
      read between the lines. For them the assurances of the great bulk of their
      newspapers sufficed. These, either themselves deceived, or fearful of
      reprisals, or simply accepting that old-time tenet of the pander &ldquo;Give the
      public what it wants,&rdquo; would not admit the possibility of this Nation&rsquo;s
      being drawn into the struggle. War? Those who prophesied it were fools
      playing with fire. They were in Wall Street&rsquo;s pay. They were traitors to a
      peace-loving people. And Centralia, for the most part, read and believed.
    </p>
    <p>
      All that man could do to foster this creed, Martin Embree did. To do him
      justice, he did not admit to himself the imminence of the conflict. His
      was the type of mind, characteristic of the self-centered, which
      translates hopes into expectations and expectations into belief. On the
      whole he thought the time and opportunity favorable for a brief,
      preparatory campaign for the senatorship. On anti-war, pro-German
      sentiment combined, he felt sure that he could ride to victory, when the
      time came, atop the crest of an irresistible wave. He made a short
      speaking tour in the Northern Tier, where The Guardian as his
      representative organ had so prospered. Wherever he now appeared, The
      Guardian&rsquo;s circulation withered. He had but to quote from the &ldquo;Under Which
      Flag?&rdquo; editorial, with such intonations as he well knew how to impart, and
      the Teutonic fury of his audiences did the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      At home in Fenchester the paper showed a slight but steady loss of
      circulation. Verrall went about the office looking, as Andrew Galpin
      indignantly observed, &ldquo;like a sob-sister on reduced salary.&rdquo; The
      circulation and advertising manager was frankly of opinion that The
      Guardian was done for. If the hyphen outbreak were not, in itself, enough,
      the split with Governor Embree was the final madness. Personally he
      maintained unbroken relations with the Governor. He did not despair, he
      told Galpin, of bringing about a practicable adjustment if not an actual
      reconciliation between The Guardian and Embree. How was the Governor to
      mature his senatorial plans without at least one important newspaper
      through which to express himself? he argued. The Bellair Journal, never
      reliably loyal, was now violently opposing him. The Record was out of the
      question on the political side. He needed The Guardian and The Guardian
      needed him. The thing ought to be fixed up&mdash;he put it squarely to
      Galpin. Could n&rsquo;t it be fixed up?
    </p>
    <p>
      Galpin, regarding him with a sinister eye, opined that it might, what time
      fried snowballs were a popular breakfast food in Sheol.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the publication of the fateful editorial the Deutscher Club had
      been, officially, mute. Even though, in a later effort from Editor
      Robson&rsquo;s pen, it had been invited to gladden the eyes of Fenchester by
      displaying the Stars and Stripes above its building, it made no retort.
      Neither did it display the Stars and Stripes. It was quietly busy with
      other considerations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Botches are at it,&rdquo; announced Galpin one morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s their line of action?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boycott. The Deutscher Club is running it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old stuff, Andy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not this. They&rsquo;ve got a committee and an organized campaign.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Print their names,&rdquo; suggested the editor with a cheery but baleful smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a minute if I could get &rsquo;em! They are n&rsquo;t so brash as all that.
      It&rsquo;s all very pussy-footed. Nothing to put your hands on legally.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are they working it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;House-to-house canvass, I&rsquo;m told. That would fit in with our circulation
      returns. We&rsquo;re shy about eight hundred right here in town, Boss. They&rsquo;re
      claiming fifteen hundred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Claims won&rsquo;t hurt us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you believe they won&rsquo;t! They&rsquo;re going to our advertisers. The
      Record is in on it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naturally. They could use some added advertising space if they could get
      it away from us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re getting it; a little. They&rsquo;ll get more if we hold up to our
      present rates. The Retailers&rsquo; Association had that up in meeting again,
      and we&rsquo;ll probably hear one of their mild suggestions about a reduction
      soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t get it!&rdquo; said Jeremy angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. If we let down now, we&rsquo;ll be on the slide. Besides, we sure need the
      money. Those libel suits of Dana &amp; Dana are going to cost something.
      They&rsquo;re juggling &rsquo;em that way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any other cheer-up news to-day, Andy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No-o. Nothing special. We&rsquo;re up against a new paper contract. Verrall&rsquo;s
      looking after that. Something&rsquo;s going on under the surface in the
      press-room. Maybe the Deutscher Club has a committee at work there, too.
      I&rsquo;d like to catch &rsquo;em at it&mdash;with a press-hammer handy,&rdquo; he
      concluded, licking his lips. &ldquo;It would n&rsquo;t hurt my feelings at all to have
      to slaughter a few Botches.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you may get your chance. Andy, what would you do if war were
      declared?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who? Me? Get out a special, with the American flag all over it, if it was
      at 3 A.M.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is n&rsquo;t what I mean. What would you do personally?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The general manager&rsquo;s face fell. &ldquo;Nothing. I couldn&rsquo;t. No good.&rdquo; He
      stretched his long and powerful arms and gazed at them sorrowfully. &ldquo;Old
      lumber, Boss. They would n&rsquo;t take me.&rdquo; He touched his injured eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; exclaimed Jeremy. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s tough. Are you sure?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tried it. No go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tried it?&rdquo; returned Jeremy, surprised. &ldquo;How? When?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Went to Doc Summerfield. He&rsquo;s been down on the border. Knows the game. He
      said no go right away. Not a chance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you did that,&rdquo; mused Jeremy with growing wonder. &ldquo;You never peeped to
      me about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did n&rsquo;t want to bother you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m mighty sorry for you, Andy,&rdquo; said his chief. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m mighty glad for
      The Guardian. We need you here. And we&rsquo;re going to need you worse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; The other looked up with swift suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Andy, you could take hold and run The Guardian if&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not by a dam&rsquo; sight!&rdquo; shouted Andrew Galpin. &ldquo;<i>You</i> can&rsquo;t quit. Not
      now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if it comes to war&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>This</i> is your war. You&rsquo;ve got your fighting cut out for you right
      here. It&rsquo;s a dandy scrap if there ever was one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is n&rsquo;t the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay-ah! Sure it is n&rsquo;t. Has n&rsquo;t got the headline stuff in it. &lsquo;Gallant
      Young Editor Goes to War.&rsquo; Hey? Is that what you&rsquo;re after?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy sat silent, disconcerted by the bitterness and anger in his
      associate&rsquo;s voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were going, if you could.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Andy winced. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s different. You could run the paper without me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not for a week!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re saying that to make me feel better about it. Jem, you <i>can&rsquo;t</i>
      quit. This is your job.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Until a bigger one turns up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is n&rsquo;t any bigger one,&rdquo; retorted his general manager with profound
      conviction.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the ensuing days it seemed to the owner of The Guardian that there
      could be no more racking one. For, step by step, as war drew nearer, the
      revenues of The Guardian declined. The secret committee work of the
      Deutscher Club was as effective as it was quiet. Uncertainty in business
      conditions was producing a logical letup in advertising, and the boycott
      was borrowing impetus from this tendency. A committee from the Retailers&rsquo;
      Association had approached Jeremy on the subject of a reduction of rates.
      He had retorted hotly upon them that they were making themselves the
      agents of an attack upon The Guardian because of its Americanism. Matthew
      Ellison had attempted to smooth matters over with a &ldquo;business is business&rdquo;
       plea; but Ahrens, of the Northwestern Stores, had sneered at The Guardian
      for making capital out of cheap jingoism, and the session had ended in
      taunts and recriminations. Its echo had followed in the loss of some minor
      advertisements. The department stores, however, could not yet bring
      themselves to abjure so valuable a medium, no matter how defiant its
      attitude. Business <i>was</i> business to that extent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime Jeremy, amidst all his worries and troubles, was conscious of a
      great and unwonted inner peace. He was doing his job as it came to him to
      be done. The present was engrossed in the fight, growing sterner and more
      demanding day by day. His future was clear before him. He knew what course
      he must steer. If The Guardian were driven upon the rocks, or rather if
      the submarines got her (he grinned with cheerful determination over this
      preferred metaphor), at least she would go down fighting, and the flag
      that she had flown would be caught up from the flood and carried on.
      Wavering and uncertain notes from that quaint herald-figure, heading its
      pages, were a thing of the past. At last it had &ldquo;sounded forth the trumpet
      that shall never call retreat.&rdquo; And, when the crash came, he, Jeremy,
      could find refuge in his country&rsquo;s armed service. That was an unfailing
      comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      More potently sustaining, even, than this was the thought that the dear
      and distant and unforgotten reader of The Guardian overseas must, now and
      to the end, believe in it.

      CHAPTER XII
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">U</span>NDER the far shock
      of declared war, the sovereign State of Centralia, unready and
      unrealizing, was rent and seamed from border to border with seismic chasms
      across which brother bandied threats with brother, and lifelong friends
      clamored for each other&rsquo;s blood. Politicians and newspapers, who live
      chiefly (and uneasily) by grace of public favor, stepped warily among
      racial pitfalls set with envenomed stakes. Having so befooled the public,
      and in thus doing lulled themselves to a false security, they were now in
      a parlous state, not daring to affront a nation in arms, fearful of the
      unmeasured power of their alien supporters, afraid alike of truth,
      falsehood, and silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was the dear-bought privilege and luxury of The Guardian in these
      great days to speak that which was in its owner&rsquo;s soul. Straight and clear
      it spoke, while for the first fortnight after the declaration the editor
      hurried about the State organizing the trustworthy newspapers into a
      compact league of patriotism, meantime living, sleeping, and writing on
      trains, in automobiles, in country hotels, those editorial battle-cries
      that variously rasped, enthused, infuriated, or inspired, but always
      stirred and roused, the divided and doubting people of Centralia.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the first stunned inaction and uncertainty of surprise, there crept
      through the German communities of the United States a waif word of strange
      import.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Deutschtum is bent, but not broken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From mouth to mouth it passed. It was spoken in German clubs and
      societies. It was proclaimed in lodge-rooms. Presently it appeared in
      print. Bauer&rsquo;s alien-hearted Herold und Zeitung published it once and
      again; first, cautiously, tentatively; the second time, building upon its
      own impunity, and the incredible tolerance of the stupid Yankees,
      repeating it as the text of an editorial word of good cheer for struggling
      Germany&mdash;with whom the United States was at war! The Reverend Theo
      Gunst&rsquo;s religious weekly spread the rallying cry; and fervent theologians
      preached it in its own tongue from their pulpits. Soon it had permeated
      the whole German fabric of Centralia, with its message of aid and comfort
      to the enemy: &ldquo;Deutschtum is bent, but not broken!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the Deutschtum of Centralia, unbroken and scarcely bent, set about
      fulfilling its vengeance upon The Guardian and Jeremy Robson.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first attack was a blast of letters, signed and anonymous.
      Correspondence enough was daily piled upon the editorial desk of The
      Guardian to have occupied all of Jeremy&rsquo;s time had he undertaken to answer
      it. Most of it was denunciation, protest, warning, threat. Several
      weak-kneed politicians, followers of &ldquo;Smiling Mart&rdquo; Embree&rsquo;s political
      fortunes, had written pressingly for appointments, evincing in every line
      their perturbation lest The Guardian&rsquo;s course might compromise them in one
      way or another. One correspondent had contented himself with a spirited
      but unsigned free-hand drawing of a noose overhanging a skull and
      crossbones.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the middle of the heap was a brief and simple note of commendation for
      The Guardian&rsquo;s course, from the hardest-worked, most sorely pressed and
      anxious man in America. It was headed: &ldquo;The White House.&rdquo; All but this
      Jeremy shoveled into the waste-basket; then plunged into his work with
      renewed spirit. The anonymous threats had cheered him only less than the
      President&rsquo;s word. They showed that his work was striking home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncertainty was what Jeremy found hardest to endure in those days. And the
      local advertising situation seemed to be about fifty-one per cent
      uncertainty, and the other forty-nine probable loss. Contracts both yearly
      and half-yearly were renewable on May 1st. There appeared to be an almost
      universal indisposition on the part of the local stores to commit
      themselves to any definite figures or estimates in advance. In the case of
      the German advertisers, or of the few which still maintained rancor
      against The Guardian because of its independence in business matters, this
      was quite explicable. But no such reasons applied in the case of the large
      majority which were holding off. Nothing in the way of enlightenment could
      be elicited from Verrall. He &ldquo;did n&rsquo;t understand it at all.&rdquo; He&rsquo;d &ldquo;done
      his best.&rdquo; Business was &ldquo;very uncertain.&rdquo; Probably that was it. They were
      waiting to see the effect of the war. If any one should be in a position
      to make a guess, Verrall was the man; for he was spending enough of his
      time among the stores. At least he was certainly not spending it at his
      desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Extra work was thus thrown upon the overworked Galpin. No dependence
      could be placed upon Jeremy from day to day now. At any hour, the demands
      of State-wide newspaper organization were likely to call him away from
      town, and relegate to Galpin all of his duties other than the actual
      writing of editorials. There were mornings when the general manager would
      arrive at the office before eight o&rsquo;clock to find three hours&rsquo; work by his
      chief already completed and on his desk with a note: &ldquo;Meetings at Fairborn
      and Rocola to-day and to-morrow. Back Thursday.&rdquo; To be obliged to handle
      part of Verrall&rsquo;s desk job also, in these circumstances, struck the
      patient and dogged Galpin as excessive. Besides, there were matters in
      Verrall&rsquo;s department which puzzled his tired mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      After one of Jeremy&rsquo;s flying trips into the country, he returned to find
      Andrew sitting at Max Verrall&rsquo;s desk. Instead of responding to his
      employer&rsquo;s greeting, the general manager asked abruptly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Verrall was a sort of political pet of &lsquo;Smiling Mart&rsquo;s&rsquo; when we got him,
      was n&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Embree recommended him to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s quit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No great loss; he&rsquo;s been laying down on his job lately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s been doing worse than that. He&rsquo;s been tying us up in a double
      bowknot. Boss, did he have authority to make print-paper contracts?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; all supplies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then God help The Guardian!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s contracted for our next year&rsquo;s paper at four cents and a quarter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Four and a quarter! That&rsquo;s half a cent above the market, is n&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What concern did he buy of?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oak Lodge Pulp Company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Magnus Laurens&rsquo;s outfit! They never tried anything of the kind on us
      before. It looks queer, does n&rsquo;t it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Worse than that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, see here, Andy. They can&rsquo;t make that stick. Half a cent above market
      for that grade of paper&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which grade? There&rsquo;s the kink. Verrall&rsquo;s tied us up on a special
      quality.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; said Jeremy.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat down heavily. A clean blotter on the desk offered him a field for
      calculations. For a few moments he busied himself with a pencil. When he
      looked up, his face was queer and drawn. Andrew Galpin waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be a pull, Andy,&rdquo; said Jeremy. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be a hell of a pull! It&rsquo;ll
      suck the yolk right out of my surplus. But we can pull through yet if&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If what?&rdquo; demanded the general manager, for his chief had stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we can hold the big local advertisers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Galpin looked down on his employer with sorrowful eyes. He cleared his
      throat, scratched his head, spat upon the floor, and was apologetic about
      it; hummed, hawed, and glowered. Jeremy regarded these maneuvers with
      surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Baby got a pin stickin&rsquo; into ums?&rdquo; he inquired solicitously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, hell, Boss!&rdquo; broke out the other. &ldquo;I hate to tell you. They&rsquo;re on our
      trail now. The Botches&rsquo; game is working. Ellison, of Ellison Brothers, is
      in your office waiting to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy left for his own den and the interview.
    </p>
    <p>
      Visibly ill at ease, the head of Fenchester&rsquo;s oldest department store rose
      to greet Jeremy, resumed his seat and proceeded volubly to say a great
      deal of nothing in particular, about the uncertainty of the business
      outlook and the necessity, apparent to every thoughtful merchant, of
      retrenchment. Adjured to get down to details, he painfully brought himself
      to the point of announcing that Ellison Brothers felt it best to drop out
      of The Guardian&rsquo;s columns.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just temporary, Mr. Robson, you understand,&rdquo; he said in a tone which
      assured his auditor that it was nothing of the sort. &ldquo;We hope to resume
      soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Mr. Ellison,&rdquo; said Jeremy in dismay, &ldquo;there must be some reason for
      this. Is it our editorial course that you object to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The visitor began to babble unhappily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, Mr. Robson! You must n&rsquo;t think that. I&mdash;I quite approve of
      your editorial course. Quite! Personally, I mean to say.... As a merchant&mdash;Well,
      of course, you have been a little hard on our German fellow-citizens. Have
      n&rsquo;t you, now? You must admit that, yourself.... Oh, it&rsquo;s all right, of
      course! Very praiseworthy, and all that. Loyalty; yes, indeed; loyalty
      above everything.... But for a business man&mdash;We can&rsquo;t afford&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a minute, Mr. Ellison. How many of your German customers have given
      notice to quit you unless you quit The Guardian?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, none, Mr. Robson,&rdquo; disclaimed the tremulous Ellison. &ldquo;None&mdash;not
      in those terms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand, Mr. Ellison. And I&rsquo;m rather sorry for you. Who are the boy
      cotters?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, really, Mr. Robson, I could n&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Of course, you could n&rsquo;t. By the way, you&rsquo;re an American, are you,
      Mr. Ellison?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The merchant drew himself up. &ldquo;My folks have been in this country for
      seven generations. Why do you ask?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just to be disagreeable,&rdquo; replied the other softly, and left Ellison to
      make what he could out of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bad though this was, the owner of The Guardian comforted himself with one
      assurance. No store in Fenchester could do business by advertising in The
      Record alone, against other stores which advertised in both papers.
      Therefore, Ellison Brothers would soon discover, in the harsh light of
      decreasing trade, that they could not afford to ignore The Guardian.
      Unless, indeed, the other stores also&mdash;Before the thought was fairly
      concluded, Jeremy had seized his hat and set out to obtain instant
      confirmation or refutation of his fears. His natural source of
      enlightenment was the loyal Betts, of Kelter &amp; Betts, but Betts was
      out of town. The next store was The Great Northwestern. There could hardly
      have been a worse choice from one point of view, for the Ahrenses had from
      the first resented The Guardian&rsquo;s independence, and, moreover, were
      members of the Deutscher Club in good and regular standing. But Jeremy was
      in a hurry. Friend or enemy, it made no great difference, if he could
      arrive at the facts. In the seclusion of his inner office, Adolph Ahrens
      bade his visitor sit down, with an anticipative smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t seen you,&rdquo; he said slowly, &ldquo;since that elegant hyphen editorial,
      to congrach&rsquo;late you on it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was Refined Sarcasm, according to the Ahrensian standard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The events since have backed it up,&rdquo; said Jeremy shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Must be great,&rdquo; surmised the other, &ldquo;to be a big enough Smart-Allick to
      rough up decent folks&rsquo; feelings whenever you want to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was nothing in what I wrote to offend any good American.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess you ain&rsquo;t the only good American in Fenchester! I guess I&rsquo;m as
      good an American as you are, if I have got a German name. You ain&rsquo;t an
      American! You&rsquo;re a England-lover and a German-hater.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you have n&rsquo;t heard that we are at war with Germany, Mr. Ahrens,&rdquo;
       said Jeremy with rising color. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been at war for three weeks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind your funny jokes with me! I know about the war. Does that make
      you right to insult every German&mdash;German-American, I mean? You think
      you got us merchants where you want us with your verfluchter&mdash;your
      be-dammt paper. Well, you ain&rsquo;t! Not any more. I got somethin&rsquo; to tell you
      about next year&rsquo;s contract.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell it, all right,&rdquo; jeered the other. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you where you get
      off. Half of last year&rsquo;s contract. Not a line more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s less than The Guardian&rsquo;s fair share.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surprisin&rsquo;, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; snarled the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is. Unless on the theory that you expect a decrease in your
      trade.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ahrens flushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in our trade,&rdquo; he asserted; &ldquo;in yours. The Guardian&rsquo;s a losing
      proposition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know why it&rsquo;s losing&mdash;temporarily,&rdquo; replied its owner, keeping
      his temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s losing because it steps on too many folks&rsquo; toes. From now on we
      don&rsquo;t need but half as much Guardian in our business. That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see. This is our punishment, this half-space allowance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can call it that if you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, just to make it even, I&rsquo;ll throw out the other half.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wha-at?&rdquo; gasped the thunderstruck merchant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You understand me, Ahrens. You&rsquo;re out&mdash;every line of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ahrens became suddenly timorous. &ldquo;Wh-wh-why?&rdquo; he stammered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I don&rsquo;t take punishment lying down. Not from you, Ahrens. You&rsquo;re
      going to find out whether you can do business without The Guardian, losing
      proposition or not!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He left the worried store-keeper and continued his rounds. Nearly
      everywhere he found the same prospect; appropriations cut from a third to
      a half, but mostly a third. Something definite was back of it. Of that he
      felt sure. But what it was he could not discover.
    </p>
    <p>
      Enlightenment was waiting for him at his office, through the medium of
      Galpin. That usually self-contained person looked haggard. &ldquo;Verrall has
      been here since you left, Boss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did he want? His job back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. He&rsquo;s got another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good riddance. What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boss, the cat&rsquo;s out of the bag. I don&rsquo;t know how they ever kept her in so
      long. Her name is The Fair Dealer; morning paper with Amalgamated Wire
      Franchise; scheduled to start next month. And she ain&rsquo;t a cat. She&rsquo;s a
      skunk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s back of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you tell from the sniveling, canting, hypocritical name? &lsquo;Smiling
      Mart&rsquo; Embree&mdash;damn his soul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; said Jeremy slowly. &ldquo;That explains Ahrens&rsquo;s attitude. Of
      course they can get along with less space. And Ellison&rsquo;s. Wants to try out
      the new, and save money on the old. We might have known! Embree has to
      have a paper here for his senatorial campaign. If he gets us, on the side,
      so much the better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But does he get us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It does n&rsquo;t look pretty, Andy. I can&rsquo;t pretend I like the scenery. There
      is n&rsquo;t room for three papers in Fenchester. Somebody&rsquo;s going to get
      bumped.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;ll be The Fair Dealer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the Germans and the anti-war crowd will get in back of it. I should
      n&rsquo;t be surprised if Montrose Clark and his gang were financing it&mdash;to
      kill us off. If we can pull through this next year&mdash;But there&rsquo;s that
      print-paper contract pinching us. Any details about the new paper?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Verrall claims it&rsquo;ll start with twenty-five thousand circulation all over
      the State. He was in here this morning to see me about&mdash;well, about
      something else; and to give us the news of the new paper. I told him we&rsquo;d
      print it when released; would n&rsquo;t give him the satisfaction of thinking we
      were afraid to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right! If we&rsquo;ve got to die we&rsquo;ll die game.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It makes me sick!&rdquo; growled Galpin. &ldquo;Oh, I ain&rsquo;t kicking, Boss! Only it&rsquo;ll
      be a tough game if, after all our scrapping, right and wrong&mdash;and we
      haven&rsquo;t always been a hundred per cent right, you know&mdash;we get ours
      from a bunch of half-breeds and double-facers, like the Governor and his
      crowd, because we would n&rsquo;t straddle a hyphen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There followed a thoughtful silence between the two. Then the owner spoke:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did Verrall make you an offer, Andy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kind of hinted round.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much did he hint? In dollars?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, a little raise. Nothing much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t honestly say&rdquo;&mdash;Jeremy spoke with an effort&mdash;&ldquo;but what
      the new paper&rsquo;s a better prospect than this, as things stand. I think you
      ought to consider it carefully.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s your best advice, is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess it is, Andy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Galpin wandered about the room, arriving by a devious and irresolute route
      at the door. He opened it, shut it, opened it again, stood swinging it
      with a smudged hand. &ldquo;Boss,&rdquo; he said insinuatingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speaking as man to man, and not as employee to employer&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bleat like a goat, Andy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;you can take your advice and go to hell with it. I stick!&rdquo;
     </p>

      CHAPTER XIII
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>NNOUNCEMENT of the
      new paper was not to be formally made as yet. Its projectors had other
      possible plans in mind. Already, however, its competition bade fair to be
      fatal to The Guardian. Simple mathematics proved to the complete
      dissatisfaction of Jeremy and Andrew Galpin that a store&rsquo;s advertising
      appropriation of twelve hundred dollars yearly, say, divided between two
      papers would give to each six hundred dollars revenue; whereas divided
      among three papers it would afford only four hundred dollars apiece.
      Therefore, quite apart from German boycott, The Guardian might expect a
      loss of thirty-three and a third per cent of the income from such
      advertisers as the department stores, which would naturally use all local
      mediums.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in this case, the purity of mathematics was corrupted by complicating
      human elements not all of them adverse. Reports of the Ahrens interview
      had drifted through the mercantile world. It became known, too, that
      Ellison Brothers had dropped out of The Guardian; been &ldquo;bluffed&rdquo; out,
      rumor said, by pressure of Deutscher Club threats. The Germans, so the
      word passed, were now openly out to &ldquo;get&rdquo; The Guardian. As a gleam in the
      gloom Galpin was able to report one morning a cheering sign:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re beginning to get a little reaction from the Botches&rsquo; attack.
      Remember the Laundry Association who lifted their contracts in a bunch
      early in the game?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because we took Wong Kee&rsquo;s ad? I remember.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re back with the American flag over their copy. Lamp this, Boss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The note he tendered was written in the most approved style of
      business-college condensation, and read as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>To the Pub&rsquo;r of the Guardian. D&rsquo;r Sir: A Chink may not be White but he
      is a Long Sight better American than any Kaiser-hound. Inclosed please
      find contract renewals. </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Resp&rsquo;y, for the Com&rsquo;tee,
    </p>
    <p>
      The Spotless Laundry.
    </p>
    <p>
      J. Corby, Prop&rsquo;r.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At least we&rsquo;re making a few friends,&rdquo; Jeremy commented.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The trouble is, they&rsquo;re not organized. Our enemies are. It&rsquo;s organization
      that counts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Friends counted, too, however, in practical as well as in moral support,
      and they materialized in the least expected quarters. The Emporium, which
      since the early quarrel had withheld all but occasional special-sale
      advertising, now came in with a full contract. &ldquo;And I take off my hat to
      The Guardian,&rdquo; said the obstinate and combative Peter Turnbull. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
      learned to do that when I see the flag passing by, no matter who carries
      it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barclay &amp; Bull restored their full original space and added to it. No
      comment accompanied the order. But Galpin went around to the store to
      explain that The Guardian understood and appreciated. Then there was Aaron
      Levy, of The Fashion, who had never forgiven The Guardian&rsquo;s attitude
      toward his installment trade. The dogged, hard-bitted, driving Jew came to
      The Guardian office and was received by Andrew Galpin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Galpin, I hear Ellison Brothers is out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay-ah. They are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did n&rsquo;t you hear that, too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you heard is right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Galpin,&rdquo; said Levy slowly. &ldquo;I been running a two-inch three-time card
      in The Guardian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t that I want to; but it brings trade. It&rsquo;s small; but it&rsquo;d have
      been smaller if I could afford to make it. You know why.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now I hear there&rsquo;s a new paper coming in. I gotta go into that. That&rsquo;s
      business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay-ah.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m going to stay with you. That&rsquo;s business too. And I&rsquo;m going to
      double my space and go in daily. That ain&rsquo;t business; but&mdash;but you
      know why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Galpin, I&rsquo;m a Jew. I was raised on kicks and crusts in Mitteldorf. I
      came here a boy and got a living chance. I&rsquo;m worth fifty thousand dollars
      to-day. I can&rsquo;t fight, myself; but I&rsquo;ll help any man who fights the
      Germans, at home or over there. You have, maybe, all the fight you can
      handle, and more. Yes? Well, that&rsquo;s my help. No; you don&rsquo;t have to thank
      me. It ain&rsquo;t for that. I don&rsquo;t like you or your paper any more after the
      war is over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stumped out, leaving in The Guardian office a vivid contrast in
      practical patriotism between an Ellison seven generations in the United
      States, and a Levy, German-born and American-hearted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even among the Germans of a certain type the strange reactions of the war
      dissolved old enmities. Coming out of the Post-Office one evening, Jeremy
      found himself approaching Blasius, the little German-born hatter, who had
      withdrawn his thrice-a-week announcement from The Guardian, after the
      Lusitania editorial. Upon sighting the editor, Blasius squared his
      shoulders to a Prussian stiffness, set his lips, and all but goose-stepped
      up to the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish to say a word to you,&rdquo; he announced precisely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those Deutscher Clubbers; they are after you&mdash;not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are. Are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Robson,&rdquo; said the hatter gravely, &ldquo;while we are at peace I think of
      my good people in Germany and I hope we remain at peace. When we are at
      war once, I think of myself, a citizen of this United States; and I am at
      war too. As you are,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;And I want my advertisement back in your
      paper, double space.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be mighty glad to have it there, Mr. Blasius,&rdquo; answered Jeremy
      heartily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you. This that I have told you I say to the Deutscher Club at
      their meeting. And what do they do? They fire me out! That is, I think,
      strainch,&rdquo; reflected the sturdy little hatter.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Jeremy it did not seem &ldquo;strainch.&rdquo; Men like Professor Brender and
      Blasius would find no fellowship in the Deutscher Club now. He knew too
      much, however, of the retentive power of Deutschtum to believe that the
      schism in the club would be important.
    </p>
    <p>
      But for every patriot who came to the aid of the sorely beset Guardian
      with financial support there were ten who were swayed adversely by
      resentment or fear. Meantime expenses went merrily on, increasing as they
      went. The Guardian&rsquo;s surplus was already enlisted in the fight. Jeremy&rsquo;s
      small reserve was compromised. Even Andrew Galpin, against his chief&rsquo;s
      protest, had scraped up two thousand dollars which he insisted on putting
      in, as he blithely observed, &ldquo;just for the hell of it.&rdquo; That, Jeremy
      prophesied discouragingly, was about all that he might expect to get out
      of it!
    </p>
    <p>
      With true Teutonic effrontery, the propagandists of Deutschtum continued
      their attempts to use the paper whose ruin they were encompassing, until
      the inutility of this procedure was at length borne in upon them by the
      adverse experience of Henry Vogt, florist and heavy advertiser, who
      personally approached Jeremy with a long and thoughtful screed in the best
      Teutonic-pacifist style of reasoning. This, Mr. Vogt argued, with the
      assurance of an old-time patron, would well beseem the editorial columns
      of The Guardian. The editor thought otherwise. As a result of that
      difference of opinion the remnants of the Vogt advertising disappeared
      from The Guardian&rsquo;s pages just one degree less promptly than Mr. Vogt
      himself disappeared from its precincts. In a rather testily conceived
      editorial entitled &ldquo;Local Dummkopfheit&rdquo; Jeremy set forth the principles of
      his paper regarding propaganda. In response to this he received three
      threats of extinction, eleven of ruin, and two of unprintable language,
      which served to restore the level of his overtried temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      While he was perusing this mail, his general manager came rambling in,
      with a queer light in his eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Want to sell, Boss?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sell what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sell out. Sell the paper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me the rest of the joke, Andy, and get out. I&rsquo;m busy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joke nothing! We got a buyer. He&rsquo;s in my office.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he violent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boss, it&rsquo;s A. M. Wymett.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy straightened in his chair. &ldquo;Wymett! What&rsquo;s he doing here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wearing lovely clothes and looking prosperous. He <i>is</i> crazy, Boss.
      He wants to get back into the game.&rdquo; Two minutes later, the ex-proprietor
      of The Guardian was confirming this latter statement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The crave is in my blood. It&rsquo;s worse than drink. I&rsquo;ve
      quit drink. But not the other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been back in it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mining journal in California. I made a little money at it. But there&rsquo;s no
      life in that. You&rsquo;re in a back-water. I want to get into the main current
      again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What made you suppose The Guardian was for sale?&rdquo; Wymett lifted the heavy
      brows above his weary, cynical eyes, as if with an effort. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you
      going into the service?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may,&rdquo; said Jeremy shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I beg your pardon. I thought you were under thirty.&rdquo; The tone was
      courteous but indifferent. It stung.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m over. A little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case you&rsquo;re not <i>obliged</i> to go, of course. Then you won&rsquo;t
      consider an offer for The Guardian?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did n&rsquo;t say that.&rdquo; Jeremy&rsquo;s mind revolved many things swiftly. The
      Guardian&rsquo;s days were probably numbered anyway. If he could sell at a
      decent price now, he could retrieve part of his own fortunes and make a
      fresh start after the war. Besides, there was Andy and his hard-scraped
      two thousand dollars. No one could criticize him for selling out with a
      view to making the larger sacrifice and going into the army. But in his
      heart he knew it was the lesser sacrifice. He knew it would be a
      surrender, with a salve to his conscience; knew it and would not confess
      the knowledge to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, well!&rdquo; said Wymett&rsquo;s even, tired voice. &ldquo;I wish I were young enough
      to get in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy&rsquo;s head lifted. &ldquo;When do you want an answer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You gave me one hour,&rdquo; Wymett reminded him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I did.&rdquo; Jeremy smiled. &ldquo;Times have changed since then. Or you would
      n&rsquo;t be back in Fenchester,&rdquo; he added rather brutally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tactful of you to remind me,&rdquo; returned the other, unperturbed. &ldquo;People&rsquo;s
      memories are charitable&mdash;and short. Suppose we say to-morrow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three days,&rdquo; amended Jeremy. &ldquo;That will be Monday. By the way, whom do
      you represent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. But who&rsquo;s behind you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Is that wise?&rdquo; drawled the other. &ldquo;In the interests of your own
      unprejudiced decision?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was on Jeremy&rsquo;s lips to return a definite refusal then and there. But,
      after all, what harm in considering?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The money will be forthcoming,&rdquo; Wymett assured him. &ldquo;Shall we discuss
      terms?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let that wait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other assented, and took his leave. By a roundabout course he made his
      way to The Record office, and there consulted Farley. The result of the
      conference was that A. M. Wymett contributed a trenchant and bitingly
      worded editorial to that evening&rsquo;s issue of The Record entitled &ldquo;Lip and
      Pen Patriotism.&rdquo; It was conceived in the old and waning style of personal
      and allusive journalism, and contained pointed references to young men of
      means and sound physique who preferred staying at home and preaching the
      patriotic duty of others, to shouldering a gun and doing their own part.
      The shrewd, tired eyes had seen Jeremy wince under the sting of the
      war-query. Their owner judged that a little impetus might decide the
      matter. And Farley, for reasons of his own and The Record&rsquo;s, was only too
      glad to lend a hand toward getting Jeremy out of the way. He knew, what
      Jeremy only suspected, that Wymett in nominal control of The Guardian
      meant Embree in actual control, and hence two papers instead of three in
      Fenchester, as The Fair Dealer would then be dropped.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had the writer of the editorial been present to mark the effect upon its
      unnamed subject, he would have been gratified. Jeremy cursed fervently. He
      then summoned Andrew Galpin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Andy, I&rsquo;m going into the army.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay-ah?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Going to sell the paper?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Might as well sell it as wreck it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay-ah?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, Andy,&rdquo; broke out his chief; &ldquo;can&rsquo;t you say anything but
      &lsquo;Ay-ah&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve said my say once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was before we were surely down and out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have n&rsquo;t changed my mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sick of a losing fight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good thing there&rsquo;s folks in the world that aren&rsquo;t. The French, for
      instance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy cursed again, wildly and extravagantly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re trying to make me
      out yellow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boss, your nerves are n&rsquo;t all they ought to be. Why don&rsquo;t you drop in on
      your doc?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going right from here to Doc Summerfield&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay-ah? You <i>are</i> feeling shaky, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I&rsquo;m not. But I want to be sure that I&rsquo;ll get through all right on the
      physical examination.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay-ah. I guess you&rsquo;ll do&mdash;physically.&rdquo; Andrew Galpin turned and
      left. His head was hanging. He looked like a man ashamed. Jeremy knew for
      whom he was ashamed. Again he cursed, and this time, himself. All the
      catchwords in the vocabulary of patriotism could not now exorcise that
      inner feeling of surrender, of desertion.
    </p>
    <p>
      A figure emerged from a forgotten corner. It was Buddy Higman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard you,&rdquo; said the boy in a lifeless voice. &ldquo;Are you goin&rsquo; to quit?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The final word flicked Jeremy on the raw. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to fight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to become of us?&rdquo; said Buddy simply. Jeremy stared at him
      without consciously seeing the open, freckled face of the boy. What he saw
      was the letter of Marcia Ames in which she had committed Buddy to his
      care.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Become of you, Buddy?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of us. The paper. It won&rsquo;t be us any more with you out of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. It won&rsquo;t be,&rdquo; sighed Jeremy. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll arrange to have you kept on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy shook his head. &ldquo;Nothin&rsquo; doin&rsquo;. She wanted me to have a job with
      you.&rdquo; Suddenly he brightened up. &ldquo;Boss, could I have a half-day off
      to-morrow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take it all if you like. Looking for another place?&rdquo; The boy thanked him
      without replying. Jeremy went to Dr. Summerfield&rsquo;s office where he was
      duly stripped, prodded, poked, flexed, and stethoscoped by that slim, dry,
      brief-spoken physician. When it was over the doctor leaned back in his
      chair and contemplated his caller. &ldquo;Want to get into the army, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To fight, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is n&rsquo;t there enough fight right here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is n&rsquo;t the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly it is n&rsquo;t. No flags. No ta-rum-ta-ra. No khaki, brave
      soldier-boy, hero-stuff. Eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I notice you went, fast enough. And you&rsquo;re going again, are n&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Different matter. I don&rsquo;t own a trouble-making newspaper. What are you
      going to do with it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Guardian? Sell it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To whom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A. M. Wymett.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a figurehead. What&rsquo;s behind him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor want to, I guess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t care,&rsquo;&rdquo; mimicked the physician. &ldquo;You talk like a spoiled kid.
      Are you going to act like one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to get in it! I want to get in it!&rdquo; cried Jeremy. &ldquo;Or out of it?
      Which?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doc, if you were n&rsquo;t an old friend&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;d punch my nose. I know. You&rsquo;ll do &rsquo;most anything to prove to
      yourself that you&rsquo;ll fight &rsquo;most anything. Except the enemy that
      most needs your kind of fighting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been doing nothing but fight,&rdquo; said Jeremy wearily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now you want to quit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had about enough of that word, quit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somebody else been using it to you? Ugly little whippet of a word, ain&rsquo;t
      it! Well, you&rsquo;re not going to profit by it, at least not with any nice,
      little, heroic, ready-made excuse to comfort yourself with. That much I&rsquo;ve
      just heard over the telephone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Telephone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This one.&rdquo; He tapped his stethoscope. &ldquo;Straight from Central. Were you in
      athletics in college?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Golf. Some football. Cross-country run.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it; the distance run. Been under some nervous strain, lately,
      too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Try to run The Guardian for a month and see!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the college athletics began it, and overwork and worry have brought
      it out. Those endurance tests will get a boy&rsquo;s heart&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heart! Have I got heart-disease? What kind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind the big names. Nothing to worry over. You&rsquo;ll live a hundred
      years for all of it. But it&rsquo;s there all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Try another physician, then, my spoiled child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, doc. Of course, I know it&rsquo;s right if you say so. But
      it&mdash;it&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather a soaker, eh? Don&rsquo;t let it worry you. You&rsquo;re sound enough to go
      ahead and raise any amount of Hades here, so far as your heart goes. I
      won&rsquo;t say so much for your nerves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is n&rsquo;t that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I know. It&rsquo;s the being counted out.&rdquo; He wrote a prescription, looked
      up from it to study the silent and downcast patient, then tore it up and
      flung the pieces in the air. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to coddle you with minor
      dopes,&rdquo; he declared vigorously. &ldquo;Jem, I read The Record editorial this
      evening. How much did that have to do with your warlike ambitions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It hurt,&rdquo; confessed Jeremy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was meant to. Know who wrote it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Farley, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you call yourself a newspaperman! Farley&rsquo;s got the malice, but not
      the sting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who did, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wymett.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wymett?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d spot his style across the continent even if I did n&rsquo;t know he was
      here. Don&rsquo;t you see the game?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wymett has come on at Embree&rsquo;s call. Embree is behind his bid for The
      Guardian. He&rsquo;d rather buy The Guardian than start his new paper. Quicker
      and cheaper. Farley&rsquo;d rather have him buy The Guardian than start the new
      paper; only one competitor in the field instead of two. Wymett sees he has
      you going; but he is n&rsquo;t certain. He borrows The Record&rsquo;s columns to force
      your hand. And you want to run away and play soldier!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to! I&rsquo;ve got to!&rdquo; cried Jeremy, beating the arms of his chair
      with violent hands. &ldquo;And now you tell me I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Steady! I never said you could n&rsquo;t play soldier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My heart&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a border-land case.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy&rsquo;s face lighted with hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can get in all right. I&rsquo;ve passed cases like yours. But let me tell
      you what it means. It means that you&rsquo;ll never see active service. It means
      they&rsquo;ll make use of your brains somewhere, in a perfectly honorable,
      perfectly safe office job where the only gunpowder you can ever smell is
      by getting to leeward of the sunset gun. Mind you; you&rsquo;ll get all the
      credit. You&rsquo;ll go marching away in uniform with Committees handing out
      flowers and tears and embossed resolutions, and everybody will regard you
      as a hero, except perhaps me&mdash;and yourself. You&rsquo;ve got to reckon it
      out with yourself whether you&rsquo;ll put on uniform and shirk or stay home and
      fight.&rdquo; Strangely enough, at this bald summons there stood forth in
      Jeremy&rsquo;s working mind two incongruous figures, each summoning him to
      judgment; Marcia of the clear, instinctive courage, and Andrew Galpin.
      Were they ranged in opposition to each other? Or were they not, rather,
      united in impelling him to the simple and difficult course? More strangely
      still, it was the thought of Andrew Galpin which predominated at the last;
      Galpin who, facing disaster and the ruin of his dearest projects with an
      alternative clear and easy and not dishonorable, had made his choice of
      the hard path and the forlorn hope, without so much as a quiver of
      indecision.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I stick&rdquo; he had said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy lifted his head. He rose and held out a hand as steady as a rock in
      farewell, to Dr. Summerfield who bestowed a passing and self-gratulatory
      thought upon the stimulant effect of psychologic suggestion properly
      administered. The physician took the hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Which?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I stick,&rdquo; plagiarized Jeremy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Andrew Galpin&rsquo;s relief when the decision was reported to him was almost
      pathetic. &ldquo;Boss, if you&rsquo;d laid down on this I was about through with human
      nature,&rdquo; was his comment. &ldquo;And now, what&rsquo;s to come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy&rsquo;s lined face puckered into a cherubic smile. &ldquo;The last trench, and
      a damned good fight in it,&rdquo; he said softly.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV
    </h2>
    <p>
      MR. BURTON HIGMAN mounted the stairs of The Guardian office, dressed in
      his best suit of clothes. A powerfully inferential mind might have derived
      from his proud and important bearing that he had matters of moment on his
      mind; might further have deduced that he had been on a railway journey,
      from the presence of a cinder in his ear. He wore the air and expression,
      sanctified, as it were, all but martyr-like, as of one who, if he had not
      already died for his country, was at least prepared to. For young Mr.
      Higman had been performing that miracle, forever dear to dreaming boyhood;
      he had been saving the world. Such, at all events, was his own glorious
      interpretation of his enterprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clock, pointing an accusing digit at V, was the only sign of life in
      the inner den. Buddy went to Mr. Galpin&rsquo;s office. Empty also. So there was
      none to apprise him of the Boss&rsquo;s final determination. A group of
      printers, scrubbed and clean, clumped down the stairs, still discussing
      the exciting rumor that somebody had bought out Robson; for every
      press-room is a clearing-house of gossip, technical and other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hey, Buddy,&rdquo; one of them hailed. &ldquo;Got a new job yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye the easy snap,&rdquo; added another. &ldquo;The old Guardian&rsquo;s sold again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much you know about it,&rdquo; retorted Buddy, stoutly and scornfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the statement struck a chill to his ardent soul. Could it be that he
      was too late? Surely the deal could n&rsquo;t have been fixed up overnight!
    </p>
    <p>
      On Mr. Higman&rsquo;s official desk was a heap of mail which, in size, would
      have done credit to a correspondence school. It was Mr. Higman&rsquo;s present
      professional duty, interrupted by his brief leave of absence, to sift out
      the anonymous communications, with special reference to those of a spicy
      and murderous character, and deliver them to his chief. To Jeremy&rsquo;s
      journalistic instinct, it had occurred as a sprightly idea to make up a
      special page for publication of these epistolary efforts. It would be
      interesting to his readers, and would serve further to enlighten them as
      to the extent and virulence of local German sentiment. Perhaps, too, it
      would check the flood. So Mr. Higman sorted and divided and contributed
      marginal marks, and finally delivered a large packet upon the editorial
      desk for the Boss&rsquo;s professional consideration, when he should return that
      evening, which, his young aide felt sure he would do, even though it was
      Saturday. Few, indeed, were the evenings that did not see a light in the
      den, close up to midnight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doctors&rsquo; protests to the contrary, notwithstanding, Jeremy came back to
      the office that evening, after a hasty dinner. Overwork might be bad for
      that second-rate and shop-worn heart of his. Loafing on the job would be a
      thousand times worse. That was one thing which his temper positively
      refused to endure. As he ran through the pile of letters, terminating in
      such suggestive and enticing signatures as &ldquo;Vengeance,&rdquo; &ldquo;Outraged
      justice,&rdquo; &ldquo;Member of the Firing Squad,&rdquo; &ldquo;Old Scores,&rdquo; or (with appropriate
      and blood-curdling commitments) those old familiars, &ldquo;X,&rdquo; &ldquo;Y,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Z,&rdquo; he
      realized that the threats were getting on his nerves. He was becoming
      bored, with an unendurable, deadly boredom, at their repetition. Nor could
      he deny to himself that they were affecting his actions, though in minor
      respects. For a week he had gone a block out of his way at night, not to
      avoid but to pass a certain unlighted alley-mouth wherein, so
      &ldquo;Well-Wisher&rdquo; and &ldquo;Warned-in-Time,&rdquo; two (or perhaps one) depressing
      correspondents had informed him, in feminine handwriting, lurked his
      intended murderers. Silly though it was to pay any heed, he had to do it.
      He had to prove to himself the futility of any such intimidation. In vain
      had Andrew Galpin tried to prevail upon him to carry a revolver. It was
      the common-sense, reasonable, unromantic thing to do. Jeremy would n&rsquo;t do
      it. He would n&rsquo;t even have one in his desk. But there were times in the
      long solitary evenings at the office when the unexplained creaking of
      floor-boards, or that elfin gunnery carried on by invisible sharpshooters
      in the woodwork of old buildings during nights of changing temperatures,
      produced sudden effects upon his handwriting which the two-fingered
      typist, Mr. Burton Higman, subsequently found disconcerting.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this Saturday evening, he had set aside nearly enough epistolary
      blood-curdlers for his make-up, and was deleting certain anatomical
      references unsuited to fireside consumption from a rather illiterate but
      highly expressive letter, when he became aware that a draft from below was
      driving some papers along the hallway outside. A high wind off the lakes
      was making clamor through the street, but it had no business inside The
      Guardian building, and could n&rsquo;t have got there unless some one had opened
      the front door. He listened for footsteps on the stairs. Nothing. He
      returned to his editing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Getting your throte cut some dark nigt is too Good for you,&rdquo; his
      correspondent had written, and suggested, in unpolished terms,
      disagreeable and lethal substitutes of almost surgical technicality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy was Bowdlerizing these, when he stopped and put down his pen. The
      floor-boards in the hallway were creaking intermittently but
      progressively. Through the noise of the wind he thought that he could
      catch fragments of a whispered colloquy. Then, quite plainly, there was a
      retreating tread, which, however, left something. What? An infernal
      machine? Infernal machines do not linger, striving and forcing themselves
      to the determining action; theirs is a simple and direct method. And
      Jeremy could feel, through the noisy darkness, the struggle of a will,
      agonizingly fighting for expression, through dread. Himself, he was not
      conscious of fear. But every nerve was tense. He sat looking at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      For what seemed an interminable time nothing happened. But the Something
      outside drew slowly, painfully nearer. The knob of his door moved, a thing
      suddenly inspired to life. Jeremy gathered himself. It turned. The door
      was drawn open swiftly. A blur came upon Jeremy&rsquo;s vision. His heart bumped
      once in a thick, dull way, then swelled intolerably. He half rose, sat
      down again heavily. His eyes cleared and the clogged blood in his temples
      flowed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood framed against the stirring, whispering darkness beyond. Her
      breath came quick and light. She was white to the lips, and more lovely
      even than the dreams of her, cherished through all those aching years.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jem,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marcia!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She made one eager step forward. A vagrant gust, ranging the darkness,
      caught the door and drove it savagely to, behind her. She threw a startled
      glance back. It was as if the impalpable fates had cut off the last chance
      of withdrawal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have come back to you.&rdquo; The sweet precision of her speech was the
      unforgotten same, blessedly unchanged in any intonation. But wonder held
      Jeremy speechless. He stood, his hands knuckling the desk, and devoured
      her with his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you not speak to me?&rdquo; she said, with a quick sorrowful little intake
      of the breath. &ldquo;You frighten me. You look so strange. Have you been ill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that he came forward and took her hand, and drew out a chair for her.
      &ldquo;Not ill,&rdquo; he heard himself say in a surprisingly commonplace voice. &ldquo;Sit
      down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head gently. &ldquo;I can look at you better, standing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her candid eyes swept over him. She saw a face thinner and more drawn than
      she had remembered it; bitten into by stern lines about the mouth; the
      eyes tired but more thoughtful, and just over the temple nearest her a
      fleck of gray in the dark sweep of his hair. Involuntarily she put forth a
      swift hand and touched it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Jem!&rdquo; she whispered with quivering lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      He seemed to brace himself against her light touch. &ldquo;That?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Oh,
      that is n&rsquo;t anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How came it there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Honest toil, I hope,&rdquo; he returned cheerfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her inventory was completed with a smile. &ldquo;You are quite as carefully
      turned out as ever,&rdquo; she commented.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Habit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no! Not habit alone. Character. And you stand as straight and square
      as you used.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A curious expression came into the weary eyes. &ldquo;Straighter,&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s your doing, Marcia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How mine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s rather complicated and long. I don&rsquo;t know that you&rsquo;d understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make me understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me time. This has been&mdash;well, startling. I think I&rsquo;m a little
      dazzled and&mdash;and dizzy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, indeed, Marcia Ames, as she stood there beneath the hard, revealing
      light of the overhead arc, was a vision to dazzle any man, and, taken on
      an empty heart, to make him dizzy. The years had fulfilled her; had added
      splendor to her compelling beauty without withdrawing that almost
      fantastically delicate and elusive challenge of youth. She seated herself,
      and Jem took his accustomed position behind the editorial table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is well,&rdquo; she said lightly. &ldquo;Is that how you receive callers on
      business?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. I have come on business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did you come from? I can&rsquo;t quite believe it&rsquo;s really you&mdash;here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From Chicago. Buddy brought me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Buddy Higman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He came after me. He told me that you were in great trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He told you that I was going to desert the ship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no! Buddy is your loyal subject. The Boss can do no wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Boss has reached the point where he is n&rsquo;t sure what&rsquo;s wrong and
      what&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not afraid of that.&rdquo; There was an implication of pride and of
      proprietorship in the words which shook Jem&rsquo;s hard hold upon himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were you coming here, anyway?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Later.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I should have seen you.&rdquo; He seemed to be puzzling out some inner
      problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had thought you would have been in the army.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I should, if I had n&rsquo;t been told that I&rsquo;m a useless bit of wreckage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please! I know all about it. I have seen Mr. Galpin. Your war is here. If
      you had decided otherwise than you did I should&mdash;I should&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re trying to make it easy for me,&rdquo; he accused. &ldquo;I should have come
      back to find another Jem from the one I have learned to believe in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To believe in, Marcia? How&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Seein&rsquo; &rsquo;s believin&rsquo;,&rdquo;&rsquo; she laughed. &ldquo;I once heard Buddy&rsquo;s aunt
      give out that word of wisdom. I have been seeing The Guardian and reading
      it, and reading you in it, ever since the war.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More than me. Galpin and Cassius Kimball; yes, and old Eli Wade, and
      others that have helped keep me straight. We haven&rsquo;t always gone straight,
      Marcia. There have been issues of The Guardian that I&rsquo;d hate to have you
      see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I have seen them. All.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you did n&rsquo;t lose faith?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never lost hope that&mdash;that you would be what I wanted you to be.
      Jem, Mr. Galpin says that the paper is losing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you go on?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For a while?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could you go on if you had more money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For a while longer. There&rsquo;d be a chance of our pulling through. But only
      a chance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you take mine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great God! <i>No!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you, it&rsquo;s almost sure loss. There&rsquo;s a new paper coming into the
      field&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said just now that it was my doing that you&mdash;you stood
      straighter than you used. Did you mean The Guardian?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Guardian. Myself. It&rsquo;s the same thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then does not that give me a right in the paper? A moral right?&rdquo; she
      argued with bewitching earnestness. &ldquo;Granted. Put in anything you like but
      your money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jem! Please!&rdquo; she pleaded. &ldquo;Will you not take it if&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not with any if.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She rose and came to him around the corner of the table, and set her hand
      on his shoulder. Her eyes were steady, clear, courageous upon his, but her
      whole face flushed into a glorious shame and her voice shook and fluttered
      as she spoke again. &ldquo;Not if&mdash;not even if&mdash;I go with it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Jem. But his face was like that of one in a mortal struggle.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment there was a flash of fear in her regard. &ldquo;Jem! There is not&mdash;some
      one else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How could there be?&rdquo; he said simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How could there be!&rdquo; she repeated with a caressing contentment. &ldquo;I knew
      there could not be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There never could. How did you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stepped back from him. &ldquo;By what I felt, myself.&rdquo; She laughed a little
      tremulously. &ldquo;I should have read it in The Guardian. Between the lines.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo; he began. &ldquo;There was&mdash;&mdash;Miss Pritchard told me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she assented gravely. &ldquo;There was. It was a formal betrothal. But
      when I saw him again I knew that I could not. It was no fault of his&mdash;nor
      mine. I remembered,&rdquo; she said very low, &ldquo;that night. That last night. On
      the bridge. Four years ago. My dear! <i>Was</i> it four years ago?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes, her voice yearned to him, wooed him. Jem&rsquo;s knuckles were white
      with the force of the grip wherewith he held to the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marcia!&rdquo; he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It made no difference,&rdquo; she went on dreamily, &ldquo;whether I was ever to see
      you again or not. I did not believe then that I ever should. But whether
      or not, there could be no one else. Some women are like that, Jem. &lsquo;Once
      is forever, and once alone!&rsquo; I think a woman wrote that.... And you have
      not even said I was welcome.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare n&rsquo;t!&rdquo; he burst out. &ldquo;I dare n&rsquo;t tell you what I feel&mdash;what
      I&rsquo;m struggling against. Marcia, I&rsquo;m down and out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does that matter?&rdquo; she broke in proudly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It matters everything. I can&rsquo;t take your money. I can&rsquo;t ask you to marry
      me. There&rsquo;s nothing ahead of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Galpin says that The Guardian is the one big, fighting energy&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Andy Galpin is a loyal fool. He&rsquo;s the best and finest and stanchest
      friend ever a blunderer like me had. Poor devil! He&rsquo;s put every cent he&rsquo;s
      got into the fight&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you will not let me put in my share?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Share? Don&rsquo;t talk nonsense, Marcia. No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not even a little part?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a cent!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you will not even marry me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; groaned the sorely beset Jem.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. I think it very hard.&rdquo; There was a palpable, even an
      exaggerated, droop to the tender and mobile lips; but in the depths of
      Marcia&rsquo;s eyes twin devils of defiance and determination danced.
      &ldquo;Good-night, Jem. No! You shall <i>not</i> take me downstairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the motor outside the scandalized Miss Letitia Pritchard, after a wait
      of an hour and five minutes, commented significantly and with a
      down-thrust inflection: &ldquo;Well!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Cousin Letty,&rdquo; said Marcia demurely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going to marry that young man, Marcia?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can I? He has refused me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Refused you!&rdquo; gasped Miss Pritchard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely. I am a blighted maiden.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Snumph!&rdquo; sniffed Miss Pritchard. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you tell me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Must you hear it from him to believe it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marcia Ames! I&rsquo;ve watched that boy since you set your seal on him four
      years ago. I&rsquo;ve seen him grow into a man, and fight his way wrong and
      right, and take his loss of you like a man and make a religion of it, and
      run his life by it, and if ever a chit of a girl ought to be proud of
      something too big and too good for her that she&rsquo;s thrown away&mdash;Don&rsquo;t
      you tell me, Marcia Ames! I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t positively know what to say of
      such doings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little electric, equally scandalized, suddenly lost its head, rushed
      upon an unoffending hydrant, sheered off, made as if to climb the front
      steps of the bank, performed an impossible curve, chased two horrified and
      incredulous citizens (who had never seen Miss Pritchard under the
      influence of liquor before, and so reported to their wives when they got
      home) up against a railing, and finally resumed the road with a sickening
      lurch, all of which may have been due to the fact that the usually
      self-contained Miss Marcia Ames had abruptly buried her face in Miss
      Pritchard&rsquo;s shoulder, and clutched at her blindly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say it again,&rdquo; quavered Miss Ames, when the errant electric had squared
      away for home. &ldquo;Say it again, Cousin Letty! I could not make him say it.
      And oh! how hard I tried.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Land sakes! Then you are going to marry him!&rdquo; exclaimed Miss Pritchard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he does not know it,&rdquo; replied Marcia, suddenly demure.
    </p>

      CHAPTER XV
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>AD any one
      informed Governor Martin Embree that Miss Marcia Ames was again
      embellishing Fenchester society, he would have dismissed the matter as of
      no political moment. That is to say, of no importance whatsoever. Politics
      was now the exclusive and feverish preoccupation of &ldquo;Smiling Mart&rdquo;
       Embree&rsquo;s days and nights, &ldquo;Aut Senatus aut nullus&rdquo; the motive guiding his
      every action. Miss Ames was not even a voter, having no residence in the
      State. Yet, by those devious ways in which women work and quite as unknown
      to herself as to Martin Embree, she was preparing a pitfall for the
      aspiring feet of Centralia&rsquo;s most bounteous smiler.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strange organizations were now coming to birth in every part of the State
      visited by &ldquo;Smiling Mart.&rdquo; They were self-assumed to be exuberantly
      patriotic and violently American, and their slogans were, &ldquo;American Blood
      for American Soil,&rdquo; &ldquo;Our Army for Home Defense,&rdquo; &ldquo;America for America,&rdquo;
       &ldquo;One Soldier Here Worth a Hundred in Europe,&rdquo; and the plausible like, the
      underlying purpose being to keep the American forces at home and thus out
      of the war until the Kaiser could successfully finish his job in Europe.
      Considering the super-quality of Americanism in the claims, the proportion
      of Teutonic names among the membership was striking. Open pacifists,
      covert pro-Germans, and political straddlers made up the strength of these
      bodies, while in the background warily lurked Martin Embree, moulding
      their activities to his own purposes of advancement. Deutschtum, bent but
      not broken, was become his chief political asset.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently these bodies merged into a State-wide and single entity, the
      Defenders of Our Land&mdash;&ldquo;Our Land&rdquo; ostensibly meaning the United
      States, though another interpretation might have been present in the minds
      of some of the participants. All was going prosperously with the
      enterprise; new members were flocking to its banner; the weak-minded and
      short-sighted were responding to its proselytizing methods, when, one day,
      the Fenchester Guardian, with that unparalleled and foul-minded brutality
      to be expected from a bloodthirsty jingo like young Robson (to paraphrase
      the impromptu but impassioned German of President Emil Bausch at the
      Deutscher Club), set the German flag above the platform of the
      organization, and below it the conjoined portraits of Governor Embree and
      Kaiser Wilhelm wreathed in the olive. Thereafter recruiting lessened.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never before had Governor Embree so felt the need of reliable newspaper
      backing. Upon the rejection of his offer for The Guardian, A. M. Wymett
      had thrown all his energy into organizing the new paper for his backer,
      the Governor, and the sub-backers, Bausch, Wanser, Fliess, the Deutscher
      Club, and the German Societies of Centralia. Ostensibly it was to be
      loyal, as the Defenders of Our Land were loyal. &ldquo;An American Newspaper for
      Americans&rdquo; was to be its catch-line, and its main editorial precepts were
      to be the already somewhat blown-upon &ldquo;Keep the Boys at Home&rdquo; slogan, and
      &ldquo;A Rich Man&rsquo;s War.&rdquo; Other than propaganda, its chief purpose, of course,
      was the election of Governor Embree to the vacancy in the Senate. As the
      Governor, perforce, was drawn by his all-excluding ambitions deeper and
      deeper into the pro-German campaign, newspaper upon newspaper had fallen
      away from him, some, like The Bellair Journal, from principle, others from
      fear of committing themselves too far. A powerful daily with a State-wide
      circulation was now absolutely essential to the success of his candidacy.
      The Fair Dealer was to supply the want.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to circulation, that was arranged in advance. Max Verrall&rsquo;s boast of
      twenty-five thousand, assured from the start, was no great exaggeration.
      Embree&rsquo;s political agents had worked hard and well. Throughout the State
      the pro-Germans and pacifists were prepared to accept The Fair Dealer as
      their political mouthpiece from the day of its appearance. The difficulty,
      which now grilled the souls of Embree and Wymett, was the delay inevitable
      and unforeseeable attending the institution of a newspaper plant. Meantime
      The Guardian&rsquo;s editorial page had become at once a beacon-fire for the
      patriotic elements and a searching, searing flame for the pan-Germanic
      scheme of which Embree was the local figurehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length the path of the new daily seemed to be clear of reckonable
      difficulties. Wymett decided that it was safe to go ahead. Spacious
      announcements flared forth on the city&rsquo;s hoardings, confirming what rumor
      had more accurately than usual presaged of The Fair Dealer&rsquo;s principles
      and purposes, and setting July 5th as the date of publication. Thereupon,
      as at a signal, part of the remaining bottom proceeded to fall out of The
      Guardian&rsquo;s advertising. Not only did the local situation develop a more
      disastrous decrease than had been looked for, but some two thousand
      dollars&rsquo; worth of products, manufactured in other parts of the State by
      German or pacifist concerns, decided that a morning paper was better
      suited to their needs than an evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      With his final determination not to sell, Jeremy had shifted upon Andrew
      Galpin the entire financial responsibility for and conduct of the paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the extent of my pile,&rdquo; he had said, turning over a statement to
      his coadjutor. &ldquo;You know where the paper stands and what it owes better
      than I do. Take charge. There&rsquo;s a worry I make you a present of. I&rsquo;m out
      of it. I prefer the editorial kind of nerve-strain, anyway. If you come to
      me with any unnecessary information, Andy, I&rsquo;ll have Buddy fire you out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want to know <i>anything</i> about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might tell me, from time to time, how long the patient has to live.
      But not too often, Andy. I don&rsquo;t want to be distracted by&mdash;er&mdash;irrelevant
      details.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So, on the day of The Fair Dealer&rsquo;s announcement, Galpin approached his
      chief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve slipped a couple of extra steps down the slide, Boss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay-ah. But we are n&rsquo;t so blame&rsquo; far from the bottom, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give us five more months, and we may get Mart Embree&rsquo;s hide to cover our
      lamented remains with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five months! Not on the cards, Boss. Call it three.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy sighed. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother me with it now,&rdquo; he said testily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m busy.
      Did n&rsquo;t I specially make you a present of that worry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Diplomacy was not Andrew Galpin&rsquo;s strong point. Most injudiciously he
      conceived that now was the time to advance a project which he had held in
      reserve, awaiting such an opening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boss,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s another buyer in the field for the paper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s the crook?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is n&rsquo;t a crook.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s the fool, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a deliberation and accuracy worthy of a better action, the owner of
      The Guardian thrust his editorial pen in the glue-pot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, <i>you</i> are, are you? And how much do you propose to pay for this
      valuable property?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;er&mdash;say fifty thousand. And assume the mortgage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fine! You&rsquo;ve got the fifty thousand ready, I suppose? In your little
      leathern wallet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s real money,&rdquo; retorted the other, with a touch of resentment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Real, of course. But whose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not instructed to state.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you instructed to take me for a boob? Do you observe a blithe and
      vernal touch of green in my eye, Andy? When did Miss Ames put you up to
      this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s good money, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; blurted the discomfited general
      manager.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too good. You ought to be ashamed of yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D&rsquo; you think I <i>wanted</i> to do it!&rdquo; retorted his aide in outraged
      tones. &ldquo;She made me. Did you ever try not to do something that little lady
      wanted you to do? It can&rsquo;t be done,&rdquo; asserted Mr. Andrew Galpin
      positively. &ldquo;Andy, as a self-excuser you&rsquo;re&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay-ah! I know. But you&rsquo;ve been running this paper like you thought she
      wanted it run over four years&rsquo; time and three thousand miles of ocean,&rdquo;
       accused the other with unexpected vigor. &ldquo;Have you or have n&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was now the editor-in-chief&rsquo;s turn to be disconcerted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m busy,&rdquo; he
      said. He reached for the implement of his trade. &ldquo;Who the hell put that
      pen in that glue-pot!&rdquo; he vociferated. Then, relieved by his little
      outburst, he added, &ldquo;Tell her we&rsquo;re not for sale&rdquo;; and, after Galpin&rsquo;s
      retreating back, he fired, &ldquo;And tell her that as a secret negotiator
      you&rsquo;re about as subtle as a street-piano.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rejection of her bid did not appear to surprise Miss Ames. Coming upon the
      proprietor of The Guardian on the street, some days later, by chance (or
      did she, as Miss Pritchard accused, cunningly plan the encounter?) she
      inquired if the price were not high enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use, Marcia,&rdquo; said Jem. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t get in. I&rsquo;m not going to let
      you commit financial suicide.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marcia was in teasing mood that day. &ldquo;I should be hardened to
      disappointments and withered hopes, I suppose,&rdquo; she sighed mockingly.
      &ldquo;Jem?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you walk along with me? Or do you think it compromising to be seen
      on the streets with the girl you have rejected?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marcia,&rdquo; groaned the tormented lover. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t stop that I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
      grab you up right here and carry you off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would commit you fatally,&rdquo; she reminded him. &ldquo;By the way, are you
      never coming to see me again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m all tied up with evening work, now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; she assented with a gravity which, however, roused his
      suspicions. &ldquo;Are you going to Madam Taylor&rsquo;s tea?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not on Madam Taylor&rsquo;s list, since I called her a tax-dodger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot imagine her dodging anything; not even a taxi, let alone a tax.
      She is so dignified and positive and &lsquo;sot.&rsquo; Will you come if I get you an
      invitation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marcia&rsquo;s delicate mouth drooped exaggeratedly. &ldquo;If I must be a sister to
      you,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;that is surely no reason why we should not meet
      occasionally.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll come!&rdquo; said Jem wildly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d walk from here to New York just to
      see you in the street, and you know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jem!&rdquo; she said with a change of tone. Her fingers just touched his hand
      lightly. &ldquo;It is a shame to tease you. But your Spartan rôle is such a
      temptation!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madam Taylor, though she adored Marcia, flatly declined to invite the
      editor of The Guardian. &ldquo;That young mud-wasp&rdquo; she termed him, and advised
      the girl to beware of his specious claims to fairness and rectitude. There
      would be plenty of other young men, far better worth meeting, at her tea
      than young Robson. It was not any other young man, however, whom the
      lovely Miss Ames selected for her special attention at the tea, but,
      vastly to his surprise and not a little to his gratification, Mr. Montrose
      Clark. There was nothing of the gallant about the public utilitarian; he
      was the highly correct head of a devoted family. But even in such, the
      aesthetic sense remains, and Mr. Clark was conscious of a distinct
      interest arising from his being selected for the special ministrations of
      the most attractive young woman in Fenchester. When she had duly hemmed
      him into the corner of an arbor with an impregnable fortification of
      Dresden and selected viands, he made the start himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I surrender,&rdquo; he announced with ponderous playfulness. &ldquo;What do you want
      of me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How unkind of you, Mr. Clark! I was about to try my craftiest wiles upon
      you,&rdquo; returned Miss Ames regretfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s a subscription. I withdraw the white flag. I&rsquo;ll fight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please! That is exactly what I do not wish you to do. I wish you to make
      peace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I a quarrel with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet. With some friends of mine. With The Guardian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The public utilitarian&rsquo;s expression changed; became more impersonal and
      observant. &ldquo;Young Robson,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s been talking to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. It was Mr. Galpin that told me about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re his emissary?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no! You must not suppose that. I come to you quite of my own accord.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why this extreme interest in The Guardian, Miss Ames?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I&mdash;There is a reason for&mdash;Circumstances&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Over which you have no control,&rdquo; suggested her vis-à-vis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Over which I have no control,&rdquo; she accepted, and her hand went to her
      throat&mdash;(Mr. Montrose Clark, seeing the swift color pulse into her
      face, discarded Andrew Galpin from consideration and came back to Jeremy
      Robson and wondered whether that pernicious journalist knew how lucky he
      was), &ldquo;have given me a&mdash;an interest, a responsibility&mdash;&rdquo; Marcia
      Ames was experiencing unwonted difficulties in explaining what was perhaps
      not fundamentally clear to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; answered the magnate mendaciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you saw as I see,&rdquo; she retorted earnestly, &ldquo;you would not be opposing
      and trying to ruin The Guardian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But bless my soul, my dear young lady! That is precisely what The
      Guardian has been doing to me. You have n&rsquo;t been reading it these few
      years past.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes. Every day. I do not pretend to understand that part of it. But I
      do know this; that Mr. Rob&mdash;that The Guardian is making a fight
      single-handed for the Nation and the war, and is being beaten because
      those who should stand by it are not patriotic enough to forget old
      scores. Have you stopped to think of that, Mr. Clark?&rdquo; The magnate shifted
      uncomfortably in his seat. To say that he had stopped to think of this
      would be untrue. Rather, the thought had essayed to stop him and force
      itself on his consideration with increasing pertinacity of late, and he
      had barely contrived to dodge it and go on about his lawful occasions. Now
      it challenged him in the clear regard of a very beautiful and very
      determined young woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Yes,&rdquo; said Montrose Clark, and left that for her to take her pick of.
      &ldquo;One would n&rsquo;t think you the kind to take such an interest in politics.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this politics&mdash;exactly?&rdquo; she asked quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon Montrose Clark&rsquo;s chubby facial contours appeared a heightened color.
      &ldquo;No; by thunder! It is n&rsquo;t. Will you sit here, young lady, and keep out of
      sight of pursuers until I can catch and fetch Selden Dana?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marcia had not long to wait. The Judge was retrieved from a circle of the
      elderly, harmless, but influential, with whom he had been discussing
      cures. The two men sat and drank more tea than was good for them, while
      Marcia made her argument and plea. Then said Selden Dana to Montrose
      Clark, smiling: &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s buy out The Guardian and turn it over to her to
      run.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We might do worse,&rdquo; conceded the magnate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not to be bought,&rdquo; said Marcia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have <i>you</i> tried?&rdquo; the lawyer flashed at her. &ldquo;You have,&rdquo; he
      answered himself, marking the response in her face. &ldquo;Well, I <i>am</i>
      dashed!&rdquo; He and Montrose Clark exchanged glances. &ldquo;Business is business,&rdquo;
       observed the lawyer with apparent irrelevance, but in the tone of one who
      strives to recall a wandering purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so!&rdquo; murmured Montrose Clark. &ldquo;Quite so!&rdquo; But there was a lack of
      conviction in his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Ames,&rdquo; said Dana, &ldquo;I pride myself on being a judge of character.
      Sometimes I meet a problem that puzzles me. Why has n&rsquo;t Jem Robson gone
      into uniform?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think Mr. Robson is a slacker?&rdquo; she shot back at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not if I read him right. That&rsquo;s what puzzles me about his staying
      behind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did it not occur to you that he has a more important fight here than
      there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It might occur to me,&rdquo; admitted the lawyer. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t know that I&rsquo;d
      care to have it occur to a son of mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She gave him her flashing smile. &ldquo;That is clever of you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I
      like that! And now I will violate a confidence, but it must go no farther.
      The doctor would not pass Mr. Robson for active service. Mr. Galpin told
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never take an afternoon off,&rdquo; sighed the lawyer, &ldquo;but some obtrusive
      business crops up and ruins the day&rsquo;s sport. Let&rsquo;s go down to the office,
      Mr. Clark, and talk this over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One more bit of meddling with the irresponsible fates which rule men and
      newspapers was committed by Miss Ames that afternoon. Magnus Laurens, just
      off a train, came in late to the tea, and was straightway seized upon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle Magnus! Where have you been, all these weeks and months?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Marcia!&rdquo; He took both her hands and looked down into her face.
      &ldquo;What a sight you are! If you&rsquo;re ever allowed to get away from America
      again, I&rsquo;ll lose all faith in our young manhood....Where have I been? Here
      and there and everywhere. Organizing the State Council of Defense. Raising
      money. Trips to Washington. Letting family and business go to the
      bow-wows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you in touch with Fenchester matters?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello! What&rsquo;s this? You&rsquo;re talking like a politician. After my vote?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know that The Guardian has been making the fight almost alone here
      against the anti-war crowd?&rdquo; Magnus Laurens rubbed his big, gray head
      perplexedly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to look into that situation. When Jeremy Robson
      went back on us&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jeremy Robson never went back on you! At least, not since war was
      probable. And&mdash;and your company is choking The Guardian to death with
      a contract dishonestly made by Senator Embree&rsquo;s man, Verrall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The devil! I beg your pardon, Marcia. Where did you learn these
      interesting facts&mdash;if they are facts?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From Mr. Galpin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Hardly a disinterested witness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle Magnus, I wish you to promise me just one thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so foolish! What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you to go to the Library this evening&mdash;no matter how busy you
      are&mdash;and go over the files of The Guardian since last March.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do that much,&rdquo; he agreed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you will do more,&rdquo; said Marcia contentedly. That first day&rsquo;s
      confabulation between Marcia and Galpin, the scope of which its object,
      Jeremy Robson, little suspected, was bearing fruit.

      CHAPTER XVI
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">L</span>ONG years unheard
      yet unforgotten, the voice of Edwin Garson, President Montrose Clark&rsquo;s
      hand-perfected private secretary, warbled with a mellifluous intonation
      over the telephone wire into the surprised ear of The Guardian&rsquo;s editor
      and owner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello! Hello? <i>Hel</i>-lo!... This Mr. Robson?... Office of the
      Fenchester Public Utilities. Mr. Montrose Clark wishes to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An unfortunate formula. It recalled the vivid past. One sweetly solemn
      thought in Jeremy&rsquo;s mind was forthwith transmuted into one briefly
      pregnant speech which shocked the private secretary clean off the wire.
      Jeremy resumed his editorializing. His next interruption, to his
      incredulous astonishment, took the important form and presence of Mr.
      Montrose Clark himself. Mahomet had come to the mountain.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Jeremy&rsquo;s invitation Mr. Clark disposed his neat and pursy form upon the
      far edge of a chair impressively, yet with obvious reservations, as one
      disdaining to concede anything to comfort. Embarrassment might have been
      conjectured in one less august. His voice was as stiff as his posture as
      he began:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had my secretary telephone you, Mr. Robson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I got your message.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I your reply, which, as transmitted to me, was that I might go to the
      devil!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I mentioned the place, not the proprietor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It does not signify. I am here&rdquo;&mdash;there was no glimmer of light on
      the round red countenance to suggest an ulterior meaning&mdash;&ldquo;I am here
      on a matter of business, in my capacity as acting president of the
      Drovers&rsquo; Bank in Mr. Warrington&rsquo;s absence. As such, I have to inform you
      that we stand ready to make you a loan on favorable terms upon the
      security of The Guardian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wh-wh-why?&rdquo; stammered Jeremy, taken wholly aback. &ldquo;Do you consider the
      paper a sound risk now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sufficiently sound.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Up to what amount?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any amount you need.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy stared at him, unbelieving.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No security I can furnish now is as good as that which you rejected
      before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That may very well be true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet your offer is still open?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes!&rdquo; said Jeremy, thinking slowly and carefully. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re assuming
      that, with the change in the local political situation, The Guardian is
      going to shift its principles. Well, Mr. Clark, if you expect that we&rsquo;re
      going back one inch from the stand we&rsquo;ve taken on public utilities, and
      the P.-U. Corporation in particular, you&rsquo;re badly fooled. We&rsquo;re just as
      much against you as if we were still for Governor Embree. I thought I had
      made that clear to Judge Dana.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have proposed no bargain,&rdquo; stated the magnate aridly. &ldquo;I make an offer.
      No conditions are attached.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ve got to tell you frankly that we&rsquo;re not doing very well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I am informed. What appears to be the trouble? Will the new paper cut
      into your circulation to an extent&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Newspapers do not live by circulation alone, Mr. Clark, but chiefly by
      advertising.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly; certainly. Local merchants appear to be pretty well
      represented in your pages.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At reduced space&mdash;or worse. Take the case of Vogt, the florist, who
      has always been good for a hundred dollars a month with us. Perhaps you
      can point out Mr. Vogt&rsquo;s present space in The Guardian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The visitor ran through the paper handed to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fail to find Mr. Vogt&rsquo;s advertisement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because The Guardian has been &lsquo;corrupted by British gold.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed! Did he express that theory to you personally?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He did. He also instructed me as to running my paper, and gave me the
      outlines of an editorial demanding that none of our soldiers be sent
      abroad to help in the war. When I said that I was n&rsquo;t interested in
      pro-German strategy he said something else, in German, which unfortunately
      I understand a little; and then &lsquo;Police!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Police?&rdquo; repeated Mr. Clark, with hopeful interest. &ldquo;Why did he say
      that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose he thought I was going to throw him downstairs. I was n&rsquo;t. I
      left him carefully on the top step.&rdquo; Signs of perturbation appeared upon
      the visage of the little magnate. He rose. His projective eyes appeared no
      longer to feel at home in his face. They roved afar. &ldquo;Police!&rdquo; he
      murmured, and added &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; in a curious, relishing tone. Suddenly he thrust
      out a pudgy hand, clawed at Jeremy&rsquo;s unready fingers, murmured &ldquo;Count on
      us, Mr. Robson, for anything we can do!&rdquo;&mdash;and stalked out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, how do you account for him?&rdquo; inquired Jeremy, referring the matter
      to Galpin, who had come in to announce another withdrawal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, him!&rdquo; Galpin turned the public utilitarian over in his mind,
      considering him on all sides. &ldquo;Wants to use us to club the Governor, I
      reckon. Now that we&rsquo;ve quit &lsquo;Smiling Mart,&rsquo; plenty of our old enemies will
      be willing to play with us on the theory that there&rsquo;ll be a change in
      policy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll have to make a better guess than that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;re right, Boss,&rdquo; sighed the other. &ldquo;Even if we did borrow,
      it&rsquo;d only be postponing the finish. Things won&rsquo;t get any better for us
      while the war is on. And when the showdown comes where would The Guardian
      be if we were in for twenty thousand more?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the hands of the Drovers&rsquo; Bank.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There or thereabouts. Well, I can&rsquo;t just see us being editorial copy-boys
      for President Puff. Can you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not exactly! Yet, you know, Andy, he gave me almost the impression of
      being really for us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s possible, Boss; it&rsquo;s just possible&rdquo;&mdash;the other&rsquo;s shrewd
      face was puckered in conjecture&mdash;&ldquo;that he might consider this war
      thing more important than his own little interests. A man who thinks
      different from us on every other blooming subject under the sun might be
      every bit as real an American when it comes to the pinch. Ever think of
      that, Boss?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not just that way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Time enough to find out. Where the lion jumps, the jackal follows. See if
      Old Slippery Dana does n&rsquo;t come round in the next few days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Come round Judge Dana did. That candid honesty of expression and demeanor
      which had aided him in pulling off some of his most dubious tricks was
      never more markedly in evidence than when he shook hands with Jeremy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ever give any thought to the libel suits against you in the office of
      Dana &amp; Dana?&rdquo; he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bother you any?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not losing sleep over them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, I&rsquo;ll admit candidly,&rdquo; said the lawyer, &ldquo;that a couple of &rsquo;em
      are no good. They&rsquo;re dead. But there&rsquo;s merit in Madam Taylor&rsquo;s case. You
      went too far there. Your own lawyers will tell you that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have,&rdquo; said Jeremy incautiously, and bit his lip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, in spite of that, I&rsquo;ve come to tell you that we&rsquo;ve advised our
      client to withdraw the action.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you?&rdquo; said the editor warily. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call it friendship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On your part? For The Guardian?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We-ell; say it&rsquo;s because I foresee that the paper is going to have plenty
      of troubles of its own without our adding to them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t always been so solicitous as to The Guardian&rsquo;s welfare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meaning that you would like to understand the reason for my present
      solicitude?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Timeo Danaos</i>,&rsquo;&rdquo; quoted Jem. &ldquo;I fear the Danas bearing gifts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lawyer smiled his appreciation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve given you the best reason I know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did Montrose Clark send you here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t like Mr. Clark much, do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not particularly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor me, either, perhaps?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I blush to say that I rather do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t trust me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, come, Dana! What would you expect!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just for relaxation of the mind, my young friend, what do you think of
      me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Straight?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Straight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re a slippery old legal crook,&rdquo; returned Jeremy without
      hesitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I think you&rsquo;re a flitter-witted young fool&mdash;ninety-nine times
      out of a hundred!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the hundredth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m looking at now. By God, you&rsquo;re an American, anyway! Here,
      Jem,&rdquo; he leaned across the table, extending a bony and argumentative
      forefinger; &ldquo;if you and I were in the trenches, fighting shoulder to
      shoulder, it would n&rsquo;t make a pickle&rsquo;s worth of difference whether you
      were a sapheaded loon or not, or whether I was a crook or a thief or a
      murderer, or not. All we&rsquo;d have to ask of each other would be that we were
      fighting in the same cause, and with the last drop of our blood, and to
      the finish! Am I right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;re right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then! What&rsquo;s this we&rsquo;re up against right here in Fenchester? Are we
      fighting? Or playing tiddledy-winks?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s very little tiddledywinks in it, so far as The Guardian is
      concerned,&rdquo; confessed Jeremy with a wry face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So far as any of us are concerned. It&rsquo;s coming to the place where it&rsquo;s a
      case of get together and stick together for us Americans. Seen Magnus
      Laurens since the Governor&rsquo;s little soirée?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Jem, flushing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Laurens thought you were in on Embree&rsquo;s deal. Why don&rsquo;t you put him
      right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He can put himself right,&rdquo; returned the editor shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hardly that; but he can be put right. There are a lot of things that
      ought to be put right for you, my boy. Things that have been wrong for a
      long time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He leaned to Jeremy again, his long face alight with an eager and innocent
      candor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jem, there&rsquo;s no use fighting your friends. The people that can help you,
      the people that are the real Americans of your kind, you&rsquo;ve always
      opposed. Come in with us now. There&rsquo;s nothing that won&rsquo;t be done for you
      and The Guardian. I&rsquo;m going to talk plain talk. Isn&rsquo;t it about time you
      made up your mind to be good?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How be good? What&rsquo;s on the carpet now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, this fight against the pacifists and pro-Germans.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to tell me to be good for that. Something else is up.&rdquo; He
      eyed the lawyer with a bitter grin. &ldquo;I might have known you had something
      up your sleeve. What is it, the Blanket Franchise Bill again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a perfectly fair bill,&rdquo; defended the visitor. &ldquo;But for The
      Guardian, it would have gone through before. Now&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ll kill it again if it shows its crooked head. Tell Montrose Clark
      that from me. And tell him that I won&rsquo;t need any loan from the Drovers&rsquo;
      Bank to do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; sighed the lawyer. &ldquo;No hard feelings, my boy. Business is
      business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Reporting to his chief, Dana stated:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t dicker.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I told you,&rdquo; replied Montrose Clark in pompous self-appreciation of
      his own prophecy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, no harm in trying.... We can pass the Blanket Franchise Bill after
      The Guardian is dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long can it last?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not three months, according to what I can gather.&rdquo; The president of the
      Fenchester Public Utilities Corporation began to puff up and grow red in
      the face and squirm in his seat. Finally it came out explosively: &ldquo;Dana, I
      don&rsquo;t want to pass the damned bill&mdash;at that price.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither do I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know, I&mdash;I almost like that young fool.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So do I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what are we going to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pull him through whether he wants our help or not. We can fight him for
      the Franchise Bill after the war.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go to it!&rdquo; returned the president of the Fenchester Public Utilities
      Company with unwonted energy and slang.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the first fruits of that confabulation between two of Jeremy Robson&rsquo;s
      oldest enemies The Guardian received on the following day a contract from
      the P.-U. for advertising space amounting to sixteen hundred dollars a
      year. Jeremy reckoned that with grim satisfaction, as giving the paper a
      few days more of life. On the following morning there came a far more
      important help in the form of &lsquo;a brief and characteristic note from Magnus
      Laurens, the pith of which was in these sentences:
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>I hope you will accept my sincere apologies. Enclosed find contract
      with the Oak Lodge Pulp Company, which, I have reason to believe, was made
      under a misapprehension as to quality of paper. Kindly make out new
      contract at three cents and three quarters if acceptable.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Andy Galpin&rsquo;s philosophical estimate&mdash;&ldquo;Every bit as real an American,
      when it comes to the pinch&rdquo;&mdash;reverted to Jeremy&rsquo;s mind. A sudden
      humility tempered his spirit. He felt that The Guardian was a pretty big
      thing and he a pretty small one. Well, in what time remained he would
      fight with a new vigor and for a broader ideal. It would not be long.
      Magnus Laurens&rsquo;s generosity meant only a respite; perhaps two or three
      months extra of fighting the good fight. In the owner&rsquo;s heart was no
      self-deception as to the inevitable outcome. Meantime the paper might yet
      beat Martin Embree and save Centralia from the disgrace of sending the
      chosen prophet of Deutschtum to the United States Senate.
    </p>
    <p>
      And just for itself, how well worth fighting for and with to the finish
      was the battered, gallant old Guardian! Jeremy thought of his paper as a
      Captain might think of his ship staggering, unconquered but hopeless,
      through her last storm to her last port; thought of her with that sort of
      devotion, of passion. And the precious freight of hope and faith and
      belief that she carried, the loyal confidence of the simple, clean, honest
      people for whom he had made the paper!
    </p>
    <p>
      Strange and unexpected accessions had come to that number; none stronger
      than the stubborn and violent jeweler, Bernard Stockmuller, who had abused
      Jeremy on the street after the first trouble with the Deutscher Club.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the morning after the Constantia was sunk, with the first American
      naval victims, an event upon which Jeremy had poured out the hot fervency
      of his patriotism, his door was thrust open and the powerful form of the
      German burst in. His face was a dull, deep red. His eyes protruded. He was
      gasping.
    </p>
    <p>
      Believing that he had to do with a man crazed by fury, Jeremy jumped to
      his feet and set himself. The expected rush followed, but ended in a
      stagger, a gulp, and a burst of unashamed tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dot bee-ewtiful tribude!&rdquo; sobbed the emotional German. &ldquo;Dot bee-ewtiful
      tribude dot you haf printed in your paper to our boys. To my boy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your boy? Why, Stockmuller, I did n&rsquo;t know&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the boy I got. My nephew, Henry. Him I brought up and put through the
      Ooniversity. He iss dead. He hass gone down in the Constantia. I am glad
      he iss dead so splendid! I am proud when I read what you have written. Und&mdash;und,
      Mr. Robson, I wand you should&mdash;I wand you should&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on, Stockmuller,&rdquo; said Jeremy gently, as the other stopped with a
      pleading look. &ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;ll do it&mdash;whatever it is you want.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wand you should take my ad back,&rdquo; said Stockmuller as simply as a
      child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bet I&rsquo;ll take it back!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mind! I dink you wass wrong, first off,&rdquo; said the honest and obstinate
      German. &ldquo;I dink Inkland made dis war. But my Henry, all the boy I got, if
      he iss only a nephew, iss dead for dis country. And now dis iss my country
      and my war!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Stockmuller. Glad to have you with us,&rdquo; was all that Jeremy,
      pretty well shaken by the other&rsquo;s emotion, found to say. The visitor
      produced a large and ornate handkerchief, wherewith he openly wiped his
      swollen eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Also, dere is someding else,&rdquo; he stated, lowering his voice. The editor
      looked his inquiry. &ldquo;Monkey business with your printer-men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I know something about that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know when they strike?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. When?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The day before the new paper comes out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy whistled softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course! That&rsquo;s when they would, assuming that it&rsquo;s a put-up job from
      outside. Where do you get your information?&mdash;if it&rsquo;s a fair
      question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Stockmuller turned a painful red.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was on der Deutscher Club committee,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The segret committee.
      No more!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are the men in our press-room they&rsquo;re working through?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The visitor shook his head. &ldquo;Weiss nicht,&rdquo; he murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind; I know! I&rsquo;ll start something for &rsquo;em before they&rsquo;re
      ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jem had now definitely fixed upon Nick Milliken, the white-haired,
      vehement Socialist, as the chief instigator of trouble upstairs. He no
      longer suspected Milliken of being in the underground employ of Montrose
      Clark and Dana. He believed him to be the agent of Bausch and the
      Deutscher Club committee. He sent for the man and discharged him. Milliken
      took his discharge, at first, in a spirit of incredulity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What have you got it in for me for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a trouble-maker. That&rsquo;s enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I&rsquo;m a Socialist? Look-a-here, Mr. Robson&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no use in arguing, Milliken. I won&rsquo;t have you around.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me a week,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;I can tell you some&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a day! Get your pay this noon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man hesitated; then with a sardonic, but not particularly hostile grin
      he bade his employer good-day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now for the strike!&rdquo; said Jeremy to Andy Galpin.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the strike did not come. Evidently the manipulators in the background
      would bide their own time.

      CHAPTER XVII
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">B</span>EHOLD, now, Miss
      Marcia Ames, conspiratress, seated in the depths of the Boot &amp; Shoe
      Infirmary, deep in converse with Dr. Eli Wade, Surgeon of Soles and Healer
      of Leather. Opinion was always to be had at the Sign of the Big Shoe;
      often information; sometimes wisdom. Miss Ames was seeking light upon her
      problem wherever she might find it. Her scheme for Magnus Laurens had been
      successful; that in which Montrose Clark was to have played the Beneficent
      Influence, had prospered in part; yet The Guardian&rsquo;s downhill pace had
      been only mitigated, not checked. Methods more radical must be found. Eli
      Wade proved at least a friendly, if not a broad-visioned consultant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A fighter, thet young man is,&rdquo; said Eli Wade. &ldquo;He don&rsquo;t go stumblin&rsquo;, any
      more. Straight, he goes. And if he falls at the end, it&rsquo;ll be in the best
      fight any man ever made in this town against a gang of snakes and
      traitors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he must not fall, Eli!&rdquo; cried the girl. &ldquo;We must not let him fall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Thet&rsquo;s the talk! If them as had oughta stood by him had done so, he&rsquo;d
      be all right to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who? Why have they failed him? Is it that they do not understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blind,&rdquo; said Eli Wade. &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t see. They&rsquo;re millin&rsquo; round wherever
      the Germans and the slick politicians drive &rsquo;em. If ever I was
      fooled in a pair o&rsquo; shoes it was them Number Eights of &lsquo;Smilin&rsquo; Mart&rsquo;
      Embree&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But your kind of people, Eli! Simple, straight, honest people. Why would
      they not stand by The Guardian?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless your soul! They do. They&rsquo;re solid. It&rsquo;s the advertisers thet are
      trippin&rsquo; up his feet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So Mr. Galpin says. The stores.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. The stores support the newspapers with their advertising, an&rsquo; so
      they rule or ruin &rsquo;em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When have they ruled The Guardian?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never. Nick Milliken says thet&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s wrong. Thet&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re against
      it. He says if you could get at what supports the stores an&rsquo; work on thet,
      The Guardian might be pulled out yet. I got my own notions about thet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About what supports the stores? The public, does it not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Part of the public.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What part?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Women-folks,&rdquo; said the Boot &amp; Shoe Surgeon tersely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon that pronouncement Marcia Ames pondered. There seemed to be a gleam
      in it. The more she thought, the more the gleam expanded. It became a ray
      of light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The women!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Of course they do. Who ever saw a man in a
      department store?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I would n&rsquo;t go thet far,&rdquo; returned the Surgeon. &ldquo;I reckon they&rsquo;s a
      few. But they don&rsquo;t wear out much sole leather there. And if any one was
      to say to The Big Shop or The Northwestern, or Ellison Brothers or any of
      them big advertisers, &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll take the women-folks away, but you can keep
      the men,&rsquo; thet store would about close its doors next week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marcia Ames rose out of her deep chair. There was a glow on her face. &ldquo;Eli
      Wade,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you are a great man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, <i>ma&rsquo;am</i>,&rdquo; disclaimed the other. &ldquo;Jest a handy man with leather.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you are a dear! And that is better. I believe&mdash;I do believe&mdash;you
      have shown the way. If only there is time! I am going to take your big
      idea to high legal talent for consultation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hain&rsquo;t had any big idea sence&rdquo;&mdash;his old, keen eyes twinkled&mdash;&ldquo;sence
      the State Capitol flew the German flag in honor of the Surrender Bill. But
      who&rsquo;s your legal talent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Judge Selden Dana.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the wonder, Miss Marcia. How&rsquo;d you know you could trust him? He
      ain&rsquo;t always been reckoned trustable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No? But in a matter like this&mdash;I am sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kee-rect! You got him. He&rsquo;s marchin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marching?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the music of war. He&rsquo;s quit slinkin&rsquo;. Left&mdash;right, left&mdash;right!
      True to the drum. Watch his feet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, Eli Wade,&rdquo; said Marcia. &ldquo;If your big idea works out&mdash;I
      shall love you forever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To Judge Selden Dana, when she unfolded it, it seemed more like her own
      idea. Unquestionably, however, it was a promising one. If there were only
      time! If the scheme could be set afoot before The Fair Dealer was in the
      field; if some way could be found to delay the publication&mdash;at which
      point Judge Dana fell to thinking powerfully. All the pleasant candor went
      out of his face, as he pondered, and it became subtle and secret and dark.
      Yet the girl, watching, liked it and trusted it none the less in this
      manifestation. She knew that the mind within was working to good ends. At
      length he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a plan for The Fair Dealer. No; never mind what it is. Forget
      that we even spoke of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is forgotten.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go ahead with the women. Mr. Clark and I will help where we can. You can
      organize the University girls?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good! One more thing. Not a whisper of this to Jem Robson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Robson knows nothing of it. What I have learned has been from Mr.
      Galpin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor to Galpin, either. Or any one else at The Guardian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you a fancy to play at mysteries and secrets, Judge Dana?&rdquo; teased
      the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mysteries? Secrets? Great Scott, young woman! Collusions and
      conspiracies! Trust an old fox of the law. If it should come to an issue
      and it could be shown that The Guardian people had knowledge of your
      precious little plot&mdash;well, I should n&rsquo;t care to have the case to
      defend. So, work as quietly as you can. I think a hundred women&mdash;if
      they&rsquo;re representative, mind you,&mdash;will about do the business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He contemplated her, with a gentle light in his pinched, wrinkled, shrewd
      old eyes. &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I remember four years ago, at the Federated
      German Societies, how you stood up, straight and brave, before all of
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you?&rdquo; said Marcia, answering his smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re still doing it. Still standing up as you did then. I&rsquo;d do a good
      deal for you, if it were only in memory of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Judge Dana,&rdquo; she said simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I&rsquo;d do a good deal for that young hot-head, Jem Robson. About
      anything I could do, I guess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said the girl again, but there was a thrill in her voice this
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Into the devious ways of the legal profession and of railroad operation
      when they run parallel it is not meet for the layman to inquire too
      closely. Suffice it to say here that Judge Selden Dana took a brief trip
      to the office of a certain railway system, and thence followed up a
      certain consignment of freight which subsequently became the innocent
      victim of cross-orders to the extent of getting itself mysteriously and
      obscurely side-tracked while certain interests in Fenchester afflicted the
      heavens above, the earth beneath, the Postal Telegraph, the Western Union,
      and all the long-distance wires with frantic inquiries. Further it may be
      stated that this sort of law-and-railroad practice is such as would have
      been severely condemned by Mr. Jeremy Robson, editor of The Guardian, had
      he known of it. He knew nothing. There were many and important matters
      happening at this time whereof he knew nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      This matter having been arranged, Judge Dana made an appointment by
      telephone, and called to see Jeremy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Got another dicker to suggest, Judge?&rdquo; the editor greeted him, with
      indulgent raillery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; returned the caller slowly; &ldquo;no dicker. This is serious business,
      young man. How long are you going to be able to hold out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you worry about us,&rdquo; said Jeremy, who had n&rsquo;t the smallest
      intention of betraying the paper&rsquo;s status to the wily lawyer. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a
      lot of fight left in the old hulk yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about this strike?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you&rsquo;ve heard about that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen Milliken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Milliken is fired.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So he told me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How came you to be on such close terms with a rank Socialist?&rdquo; taunted
      the editor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be on terms with a rattlesnake if he&rsquo;ll play my game,&rdquo; replied the
      lawyer with one of those bursts of frankness wherewith he occasionally
      favored Jeremy. &ldquo;Never mind Milliken now. Can you beat out this strike if
      it comes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Jeremy looked tired and old.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he said lifelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there any danger of The Guardian having to give up in the next month?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s getting harder sledding all the time,&rdquo; confessed Jeremy. &ldquo;The strike
      might finish us, at that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Publication date of The Fair Dealer is postponed two weeks,&rdquo; observed the
      lawyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! What&rsquo;s caused that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How should I know? They say part of the machinery has been lost in
      transit. It was shipped via the Lake Belt Line, for which I happen to be
      counsel. But I can&rsquo;t imagine&rdquo;&mdash;he paused, and Jeremy saw a distinct,
      enlightening flicker of his left eyelid&mdash;&ldquo;I can <i>not</i> imagine
      what has caused the unfortunate delay! I should think there might be
      danger of their losing some of their promised advertising!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, their contracts are all made. Trust Verrall for that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doubtless. But will they hold? I understand they specified an issue of
      July 5th.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What of it?&rdquo; said Jeremy wearily. &ldquo;The advertisers will make new
      contracts. You could n&rsquo;t pry &rsquo;em away from that twenty-five
      thousand circulation at the low rate given.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who knows what the morrow may bring forth?&rdquo; said the lawyer oracularly.
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I could a tale unfold&rsquo;&mdash;&rdquo; He stopped, with a large gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s always a cloven hoof that goes with your kind of tail,&rdquo; retorted
      Jeremy. &ldquo;But if you&rsquo;ve really got anything cheery up your sleeve, spring
      it. I could do with a little cheering-up right now. That postponement of
      publication is a good start. What&rsquo;s next?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My son, the less you know just now, the better. But I&rsquo;ll tell you this:
      Some of us who are&mdash;well&mdash;interested in The Guardian, for
      reasons of our own, are skating on the thin edge of conspiracy, treason,
      stratagem, and crime, as it is. Do you want in? You do not want in! You
      stay out and keep a stiff upper lip. Can&rsquo;t use any of our spare cash? No!
      Well, if your neck was a little stiffer it&rsquo;d break! Good-bye, and hang
      on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All of which Jeremy promptly retailed to the faithful Galpin with the
      comment:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something&rsquo;s certainly up, but how much is for us, and how much for Clark,
      Dana &amp; Company, I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You got a mean, suspicious sort of mind, Boss,&rdquo; grinned the general
      manager. &ldquo;But I admit I don&rsquo;t get that bunch yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor I. But I&rsquo;m watching.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somebody&rsquo;s pushing on the reins upstairs again. If the strike don&rsquo;t bust
      this week, I&rsquo;m a goat! I caught Milliken hanging round yesterday and
      chased him out. Gave him the police talk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dana knew all about Milliken and the strike. Had it from Milliken
      himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wheels and wheels and wheels!&rdquo; commented Andy, making expansive and
      elegantly rounded gestures. &ldquo;Wheels within wheels; wheels without wheels;
      wheels going in opposite directions and at different speeds. They make me
      dizzy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They made Jeremy dizzy, too. At least, something made him dizzy. He was
      dizzy a good deal of the time, and tired. Very tired. He thought that some
      vague and hopeful day he&rsquo;d take a week off. When things quieted down. When
      Andy&rsquo;s anathematized &ldquo;Botches&rdquo; let up on the paper. When advertisers
      ceased to trouble. When the whole show was over and the final issue of The
      Guardian had closed with its final challenge to the forces of Deutschtum.
      When his heart stopped crying out for Marcia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime he wearily wished he could get a night&rsquo;s sleep.

      CHAPTER XVIII
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>UCH advantage as
      the bee may boast over the butterfly is proverbially supposed to inhere in
      its industrious habits. But Miss Marcia Ames, now adopting the schedule of
      the bee at its busiest, found her earlier butterfly proclivities of
      advantage in that they had put her in touch with certain flowers of
      Fenchester&rsquo;s social world with which the harder-worked honey-collector
      might not have been so familiar. Visiting these upon her proselytizing
      errand, this enterprising flitter, still trailing clouds of glory from her
      butterflyhood, left behind her the fructifying pollen of the Great Idea.
      In one respect&mdash;to carry the entomological metaphor a step farther&mdash;she
      was like a moth rather than either the butterfly or the bee, since her
      good works, to be effective, must needs be carried on in the dusk of a
      semi-secrecy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Behold our bee, now, hovering about the garden of that ancient but still
      lively wasp, Madam Dorothea Taylor, until bidden to alight and state her
      errand, whereof the venerable one, having already received some hint from
      her friend, Letitia Pritchard, is alertly suspicious. Accepting the
      invitation, the visiting bee leads up diplomatically to the first point of
      risk, the name of Jeremy Robson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A slanderer!&rdquo; rasps the wasp. &ldquo;A character-robber. A rag-tag and bob-tail
      cheap-and-nasty politician!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The bee goes on with her musical, conciliatory, and soothing song, and
      presently mentions The Guardian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t name the rag to me!&rdquo; blares the enraged wasp. &ldquo;A filthy sheet! The
      poison of asps! A mud-slinger! A tool of that torch-and-scaffold,
      anarchistic harlequin, Martin Embree.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you read it lately?&rdquo; queries the bee. &ldquo;God forbid! I would n&rsquo;t
      endure a copy in the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How fortunate,&rdquo; hums the bee sweetly, &ldquo;that I brought only small portions
      of one or two copies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cleverly stimulating the other&rsquo;s curiosity, our cunning bee succeeds in
      persuading her to look at the clipping wherein Martin Embree, Emil Bausch,
      and the Kaiser stand forth wreathed in the olive of a mock-pacifism. Now
      is the wasp&rsquo;s angry voice hushed, as she peruses this and follows it with
      the now famous &ldquo;hyphen&rdquo; editorial, and the political quittance of Martin
      Embree.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He appears to have lost none of his venom,&rdquo; observes the reader, &ldquo;though
      he is now turning it against his own kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are not his own kind!&rdquo; The bee for the moment forgets that she is
      committed to the soft footing of diplomacy. &ldquo;I will not hear it said that
      they are his own kind! We are his own kind: we Americans!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hoity-toity and here&rsquo;s a to-do!&rdquo; cries the aged wasp. &ldquo;Are we, indeed?
      Not I, you minx! That gullible old fool, Selden Dana, has been preaching
      from the same text. He wheedled me into withdrawing my libel suit against
      the young backbiter. Why I was silly enough to do so, <i>I</i> don&rsquo;t know.
      Now, what are you asking me to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Help,&rdquo; answers the visiting bee, and sets forth a general outline of her
      plan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boycott,&rdquo; observes the shrewd old wasp, after turning it over in her
      mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, not in the least!&rdquo; disclaims the bee. &ldquo;That would be illegal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh! Who cares for laws! Boycott it is, against any merchant who won&rsquo;t
      support The Guardian. Is n&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It might appear&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Appear! Don&rsquo;t hem-and-haw with me, Miss Pert. I can hire Dana to do that.
      You&rsquo;re asking the women of this city to boycott the stores that boycott
      The Guardian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me, no!&rdquo; returns the bee demurely. &ldquo;We are only suggesting a
      practical method of showing appreciation of Mr. Rob&mdash;of The
      Guardian&rsquo;s patriotic course. And if you will join our little association
      and bring your Red Cross work down with you for a few minutes each
      morning, that is all we ask of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of me! There&rsquo;s the point. <i>Me!</i> I&rsquo;ve been libeled and slandered and
      traduced and held up to public scorn,&rdquo; sizzles the wasp (who had, since
      the withdrawal of the suit, enjoyed one last reading of Judge Dana&rsquo;s
      comprehensive complaint with stimulating influence upon her style), &ldquo;and
      now you have the assurance to ask me to rush to the aid of this reckless
      young muck-raker. It&rsquo;s absurd! It&rsquo;s outrageous! It&rsquo;s an impudence! It&rsquo;s an
      imposition! It&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s&mdash;I&rsquo;ll do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew you would,&rdquo; softly says the bee (who had n&rsquo;t known anything of the
      sort, and has, indeed, dreaded this visit above all others). &ldquo;I do not
      think you will ever be sorry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope <i>you</i> won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; retorts the wasp vigorously and significantly.
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a dangerous character, that young Robson. Have a care of him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having made captive her most difficult subject, the missionary bee now
      descends upon one hardly less difficult, Mrs. Vemam Merserole, wife (and,
      if rumor be correct, head of the house) of the &ldquo;nickel-in-the-slot&rdquo;
       corner. Mrs. Merserole, looking meek, according to her practice, but
      stubborn, according to her character, harks back to past injuries, and
      talks darkly of defamers of character as one might say &ldquo;persecutors of the
      saints.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was before we were at war, Mrs. Merserole,&rdquo; her caller reminds her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Merserole looks up quickly from her clasped hands. &ldquo;You think that
      to-day Mr. Robson would not make an unprincipled attack upon&mdash;upon a
      clergyman who did nothing more than his duty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Diplomatic though her errand be, Marcia will not pass this challenge to
      her truthfulness. &ldquo;I do not say that. Nor do I admit that what he wrote
      was unprincipled. He wrote what he believed. He would do that again
      to-morrow. But I do know that he is a broader and more charitable man than
      he was then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;War does not change men&rsquo;s characters, Miss Ames,&rdquo; says the rector&rsquo;s wife
      austerely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then God help the men!&rdquo; bursts out Marcia. &ldquo;And God help the country!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, my dear!&rdquo; says the older woman, shaken by the girl&rsquo;s vehemence. &ldquo;You
      think it does? Perhaps you&rsquo;re right. Yes; I think you&rsquo;re right. But Mr.
      Robson&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Merserole,&rdquo; breaks in Marcia with apparent irrelevance, &ldquo;I have
      heard that your boy picked out the aviation service because it is the most
      dangerous, and that you told him that he had done what you would choose
      him to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other does not reply. But her lips quiver, and her tightly clasped
      fingers press in on each other. Marcia lays her warm, strong little hand
      over them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have done a great thing like that. And now I ask you to do a little
      thing. To forget an old injury.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Mr. Merserole&mdash;he feels toward The Guardian&mdash;I cannot
      express it to you,&rdquo; falters the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Guardian is a forlorn hope,&rdquo; returns Marcia. &ldquo;Mr. Robson is
      sacrificing it and with it all his ambitions and his future for the sake
      of a principle. That is his part in the war; the only part he can play.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it? I had heard otherwise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you heard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That he persuaded a doctor to declare him unfit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a lie,&rdquo; declares Marcia calmly, and gives the facts. &ldquo;Who told
      you the lie?&rdquo; she asks, at the close of the recital.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other hesitates. &ldquo;Mrs. Robert Wanser,&rdquo; she says, at length. &ldquo;I will
      speak to the rector about your plan,&rdquo; she adds, and, by her tone, Marcia
      knows that she has won another recruit.
    </p>
    <p>
      So from house to house flits the busy bee, arguing here, pleading there,
      feeling her way cautiously in doubtful places and always imposing secrecy
      until the organization shall be completed; enlisting trustworthy
      lieutenants,&mdash;Miss Pritchard; little Anne Serviss, vice-president of
      the senior class at Old Central; Magnus Laurens&rsquo;s daughter, who comes down
      from the country to hot and dusty Fenchester to help; Miss Abbie
      Rappelje, sister of the Professor of Economics; Mrs. Montrose Clark; and,
      chiefest of all, the wary and wily Judge Selden Dana,... who, by the way,
      is working out a little scheme of his own all the time, in which Marcia is
      no more than a pawn, and without saying a word to her about it. Trust Dana
      for that!

    <p>
      While these processes were moving more or less bumpily on their appointed
      course outside The Guardian office, those wheels within wheels, upon which
      Andrew Galpin had philosophically animadverted, were whirling at an
      accelerated pace inside. The postponement of The Fair Dealer&rsquo;s publication
      day had been a blow to certain developing plans in The Guardian&rsquo;s
      press-room. When a labor leader has sedulously fomented ill-feeling,
      worked it almost to the point of explosion, promised the malcontents
      another job at increased pay if they strike to order on a certain date,
      and then had that date unavoidably postponed, his position becomes
      difficult and his next step doubtful. Such was the situation in the
      press-room of The Guardian. It was accentuated by the fact that The
      Guardian&rsquo;s editor had taken to editorializing quite frankly upon certain
      developments in the labor world outside, thereby furnishing extra
      incentive to the waiting strikers, for, radical though he was, Jeremy held
      himself as free to criticize labor as capital when he deemed it in the
      wrong. In fact he was in the midst of a mid-afternoon editorial for the
      morrow on &ldquo;Labor and the War,&rdquo; when he came out of the fog of mental toil
      into a sensation of something wrong, something lacking. The presses had
      stopped. Surely it was n&rsquo;t time for the run to be over! No; his watch
      marked four-ten.
    </p>
    <p>
      From above sounded the scuffling of feet; a door opened and a furious,
      hard-breathing voice shouted an oath. Now there was a hubbub of voices,
      dull in the distance, and the floor shook lightly under some impact.
      Jeremy got to his feet, shaking and sweating. To such a condition of
      nerves had the overwork and overstrain of the last few weeks reduced him.
      He forced himself toward the door&mdash;when, with a roar and a clack, the
      presses took up their rhythm again, making sweet music for the relief of
      his beleaguered mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      He returned to his editorial. But the savor of the work had gone. He was
      too deeply preoccupied with what had happened upstairs. That was Galpin&rsquo;s
      department; he made it a practice not to interfere. Yet, until the last
      run was off the presses and the machinery was silenced, he sat, intent and
      speculating.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clang of a gong sounded outside. From his window he caught a glimpse
      of a departing ambulance. Was there some connection between that and the
      turmoil above? The men had not come down, though it was past time. He
      decided to go to the press-room and investigate.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the top step he stopped short. Somebody was making a speech. Surely
      that was Nick Milliken&rsquo;s voice&mdash;Milliken, who had been threatened
      with arrest if he returned! Milliken&rsquo;s voice and Milliken&rsquo;s propaganda,
      for he was saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some day we&rsquo;ll own this stick-in-the-mud old plant, all of us together.
      We&rsquo;ll own it and run it for the common good and the common profit. Some
      day we&rsquo;ll own all production, and run it for the common good and the
      common profit! That&rsquo;ll come. But that ain&rsquo;t our job now, comrades. We&rsquo;ve
      got something else on hand, first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The editor and owner of the plant, thus cavalierly committed to common
      control, laid his hand on the knob of the door, but paused to hear the
      speaker&rsquo;s next words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now about this strike: I&rsquo;m for the strike. I&rsquo;m for any strike&mdash;at
      the right time. But this ain&rsquo;t the time. Lemme give you a little parable,
      comrades.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy sat upon the top step and listened to the parable of Milliken, the
      Socialist. When it was over he tiptoed quietly down the stairs and into
      his own office. There he lay in wait until he heard the meeting break up
      and the tramp of descending feet. Standing sentry, he intercepted the
      speaker and called him into the sanctum.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you come back to the job?&rdquo; said Jeremy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; returned the other. He was spent and haggard, but his eyes were
      alight with triumph. &ldquo;I was never off it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard your speech&mdash;part of it&mdash;enough so I knew I had you
      wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It did the business. The strike&rsquo;s spoiled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Off?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Might as well be. There&rsquo;ll be six or seven Germans quit. But they can&rsquo;t
      do much without Girdner. He&rsquo;s the one that&rsquo;s been playing merry hell with
      the whole show.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Girdner?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hospital.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What happened to him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He fell downstairs,&rdquo; said Milliken casually but happily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Unassisted?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He threw me out of the meeting. Easy picking for him. You&rsquo;d be surprised
      to see how quick he hustled me through the door,&rdquo; said the other
      regretfully. &ldquo;He might have hurt me bad; I would n&rsquo;t be surprised. He was
      real rough with me. Then, just as we got to the top of the stairs, one of
      my arms took to flopping round kind of general, and he got hit on the jaw.
      Queer how things come back to you!&rdquo; observed the white-haired Socialist,
      with surpassing innocence. &ldquo;It never came into my mind till then that I
      once spent two years in a fighters&rsquo; stable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said. Jeremy thoughtfully. &ldquo;No&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know. I thought you
      Socialists&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you capitalists&mdash;&rdquo; interrupted the other with instant
      retort.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess you were an American before you were a Socialist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I can&rsquo;t be both I&rsquo;ll quit being either,&rdquo; answered the other
      fiercely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do see!&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re in that same trench with Judge Dana,
      where it makes no difference who or what a man is so long as he fights on
      the level and to a finish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess I am&mdash;comrade!&rdquo; said Milliken, the Socialist.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIX
    </h2>
    <p>
      SOMETHING queer happened to young Mr. Jeremy Robson on the night of July
      10th. Despite a lumpy sensation in the back of his neck and his habitual
      effect of being absolutely fagged out by the day&rsquo;s work, he had gone to
      bed with the resilient assurance of youth that he would awake refreshed
      and fit in the morning. Instead, he woke up feeling aged beyond the power
      of the mind to grasp: a mere crumbling ruin, compared to which the pyramid
      of Cheops was a parvenu and the Druidic altars of Stonehenge the mushroom
      growth of a paltry yesterday. Worse than this, there was a dregsy, bitter
      taste in his soul. It grew and spread; and presently as he lay miserably
      wondering at it, developed into a gall-and-worm-wood loathing of the
      circumstanding world&rsquo;s activities, but particularly of his work, the
      purposeless, futile, inexorable toil of The Guardian, daily re-galvanized
      into the appearance of life, but in reality doomed to swift and hopeless
      dissolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment his thoughts turned from hatred to Marcia. A receding vision,
      &ldquo;the lands of Dream among,&rdquo; hopelessly beyond the reach of a Failure.
      Inexpressibly old, Mr. Jeremy Robson wrote &ldquo;Finis&rdquo; upon the scroll of his
      fate and sat up in bed the better to contemplate the wreckage which had
      been himself. Immediately things began to revolve in his head. Wheels.
      Andrew Galpin&rsquo;s wheels. Wheels of all sizes and brutally distorted shapes
      whirling in counter-directions with an imbecile and nauseous suavity,
      weaving into unendurable patterns the warp and woof of his comprehensive
      hatred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bosh!&rdquo; said Jeremy Robson. He stood up and promptly fell down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too much pressure,&rdquo; pronounced Doc Summerfield, arriving at speed. &ldquo;You
      stop, young man, or you&rsquo;ll be stopped.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me something to steady me up,&rdquo; begged Jeremy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to go to the
      office to-day!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you?&rdquo; returned the physician grimly. &ldquo;Drink this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sleep descended powerfully upon Jeremy, blotting out hatreds and worries
      and all other considerations for the time. It held him in its toils for
      successive days and nights; how many he could not have told. Once he woke
      up, quite clear in his head, and looked out across a broad piazza, through
      elms and shrubbery upon the crested lake, and was about to congratulate
      himself upon his recovery (though he could not quite figure out to what
      pleasant spot he had been translated) when Mrs. Montrose Clark came into
      the room&mdash;which was, of course, delirium&mdash;and asked him how he
      felt and whether he was hungry. Later Doc Summerfield arrived, declined to
      explain, said, &ldquo;Drink this&rdquo; (he was always and forever saying, &ldquo;Drink
      this&rdquo;) &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll tell you all about it tomorrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So, on the morrow&mdash;or it might have been the following century for
      all Jeremy knew&mdash;Doc Summerfield came back and delivered a syncopated
      monologue:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. You are at Mr. Montrose Clark&rsquo;s cottage.... No; you certainly can&rsquo;t
      go home. Don&rsquo;t be a jackass!... No; the paper has n&rsquo;t gone up. It&rsquo;s doing
      very well without you.... No; of course you&rsquo;re not going down to the
      office. Don&rsquo;t be a fool!... Heart? No; it isn&rsquo;t your heart. It&rsquo;s nerves.
      Overwork. That&rsquo;s all. Don&rsquo;t be a ninny.... Certainly you&rsquo;ll be all right.
      In a few days, if you&rsquo;ll behave yourself and not act like a blithering
      simpleton.... Drink this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What seemed to Jeremy so long and uncertain a period was, in reality, only
      a little over a week. Came a day when the Montrose Clarks sent him out for
      a ride with their chauffeur, otherwise unattended, and he prevailed upon
      that guileless youth to take him to the office.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t wait. I&rsquo;ll telephone,&rdquo; said he, and made for his den.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first, as he entered, he felt a qualm of nausea. This passed, to be
      succeeded by a dull languor. He shook this off and, finding that wheels no
      longer revolved within his head when he tried to think, he decided that he
      was fit for work. Pursuing this theory, he settled to his work-table when
      the door burst open and Andrew Galpin rushed in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where the devil&mdash;&rdquo; he began and started back as from an apparition.
      &ldquo;For the love of <i>Mike!</i>&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Where did you come from?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Montrose Clark cottage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go back! Get out! You ought to be in bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been. I&rsquo;m tired of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would Doc Summerfield say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The usual thing: Drink this.&rsquo; What do you suppose he&rsquo;d say to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The general manager was red, perspiring, and disheveled, and there was a
      vague, wild, and incomprehensible gleam in his eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me? What&rsquo;s he got to do with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do I know? You don&rsquo;t look&mdash;well, normal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I!&rdquo; retorted his subordinate with some heat. &ldquo;Then just lemme tell
      you that I&rsquo;m the only normal gink left in the business. I&rsquo;m sane; <i>that&rsquo;s</i>
      what&rsquo;s the matter with <i>me!</i> That&rsquo;s what makes me look so queer and
      feel so lonely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;d have to prove it to me,&rdquo; retorted his chief. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;ve
      got it, too. Only yours takes a different form from the rest. Go back to
      bed, Boss. But first, where&rsquo;s that file of special contracts?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Try the cabinet there. What do you want of &rsquo;em?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Galpin found the documents, and turned upon Jeremy. &ldquo;Boss, this man&rsquo;s town
      had gone batty. Plumb bugs! Hopeless case.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know what happens to a man who discovers that everybody else is
      crazy, Andy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s gone completely nuts over The Guardian,&rdquo; pursued the other, ignoring
      the intimation. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re a hobby. An obsession. A fad! A fashion! A killing!
      A&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s got you, Andy?&rdquo; asked the editor anxiously. &ldquo;Come down to earth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t! I&rsquo;m a balloon. Watch me soar!&rdquo; The usually stolid manager
      performed a bacchanalian fling. &ldquo;Contracts!&rdquo; he panted. &ldquo;Reams of &rsquo;em!
      Money! Gobs of it! Circulation! Going uh-uh-up! Whee!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Andy, I&rsquo;m not feeling very husky; but in a moment I shall throw you down
      and sit on your neck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t be done! I could lick the Kaiser and all his Botches single-handed.
      Boss, the luck has broke! The town is coming our way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How? Why? What&rsquo;s happened?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to tell you, but I have n&rsquo;t got time. They&rsquo;re waiting for me
      downstairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Advertisers. Waiting to break into The Guardian. They&rsquo;re lined up in the
      hallways. I&rsquo;ll have to issue rain-checks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop talking like a lunatic, Andy, and explain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The demented manager perched upon the corner of the editorial table, with
      an effect of being poised for instant flight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask me to explain, because I can&rsquo;t. I tell you the advertisers of
      this town have suddenly got a mania&mdash;and we&rsquo;re the mania. It began
      two days ago and it&rsquo;s been growing worse right along. I did n&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d
      ever be able to break through to the office this morning. They waylaid me
      on the way down. I don&rsquo;t know who began it. I think it was Stormont, of
      Stormont &amp; Lehn. He fell out of a doorway on me, and when I got loose
      there was a thousand-dollar advertising contract stuck down my collar.
      Then old Pussy-foot Ellison came sobbing up the street&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the devil&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t interrupt me or I&rsquo;ll bust! And never mind my metaphors. It comes
      easier that way. Well, he blubbered out his sweet message of intending to
      double his space in the paper instead of cutting us out; and before I&rsquo;d
      got his tears fairly brushed off my shoulder, Vogt, the Botch, rushed in,
      threw his arms round my neck and tried to kiss me, and handed me an
      eight-hundred-dollar-space order in lieu of damages; and asked whether we
      would n&rsquo;t like flowers sent round mornings, gratis! Boss, I can just see
      you writing an editorial with one of Vogt&rsquo;s tea-roses stuck coyly behind
      your ear&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind my ear. Go on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can I remember who mobbed me! I do recall that Arndt, of the
      furniture shop, knocked me down and dragged me into an alley; and when I
      came to there was a signed agreement to restore all the space they lifted
      from us, and twenty-five per cent over and above. And, by the way, I saw
      the Governor hiking into Bausch&rsquo;s office and looking about as cheerful as
      a banshee with a bellyache. Oh, there&rsquo;s big doings of some kind, you bet!
      All the morning the &rsquo;phone has been buzzing and&mdash;Who&rsquo;s that
      having hysterics in the hall?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He threw open the door, and Mr. Adolph Ahrens, of The Great Northwestern
      Stores, bounded in, uttering a wild, low wail, the burden of which seemed
      to be something about a &ldquo;misunderstanding.&rdquo; He also mentioned the word
      &ldquo;blackmail,&rdquo; and hastily retracted it. He had always, he asserted
      passionately, been friendly to The Guardian. He admired it for its lofty
      courage, its unfailing fair-mindedness, its patriotism; and as an
      advertising medium he considered it without parallel or equal.
    </p>
    <p>
      In token of which he had brought his copy for a full page in that day&rsquo;s
      issue. And would Mr. Robson kindly note that he had taken a box for the
      Loyalty Rally on Saturday, being as good an American as anybody, even if
      he did bear a German name? And so, exit Mr. Ahrens, stringing out
      deprecatory statements about a misunderstanding as he went.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For Heaven&rsquo;s sake, Andy, what does it all mean?&rdquo; The general manager
      shook his disheveled head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Search me!&rdquo; he said gravely. &ldquo;Except for this: It means that The Guardian
      wins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you reckoned it up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t need to. Outside a few of the Old Prussian Guard in the Deutscher
      Club we&rsquo;ve got everything back that we lost, and a heap more on top of
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But who&rsquo;s been doing it? And what have they been doing?&rdquo; cried the
      bewildered Jeremy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not guilty on either count. Somebody&rsquo;s been impressing our friends, the
      enemy, that there&rsquo;s just one way to be saved, and that the only A1,
      guaranteed salvation is via The Guardian. Watch &rsquo;em crowd to the
      mourners&rsquo; seat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the paper been doing since I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a thing. Not a blooming thing, Boss, but just sawing wood. This game
      was n&rsquo;t started from inside. I&rsquo;ll swear to that. Whoever&rsquo;s been doing the
      trick&mdash;and it looks to me as if there&rsquo;d been some expert and
      ree-fined blackmail going on&mdash;has been keeping clear of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Judge Dana!&rdquo; exclaimed Jeremy, struck with a thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve been sort of wondering about him myself,&rdquo; admitted the other.
      &ldquo;Met him on the street yesterday and he wanted me to call him up as soon
      as you got back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. Here I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay-ah? You&rsquo;ve got to show me. You&rsquo;re not back till Doc Summerfield says
      you&rsquo;re back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door opened and the amazed physiognomy of Buddy Higman appeared. &ldquo;The
      Boss!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Holy Moses! I&rsquo;m a liar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s up, Buddy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been stallin&rsquo; off Doc Summerfield and a crazy show-foor downstairs.
      They&rsquo;re waitin&rsquo; now. They said would you come peaceable or be took. I told
      &rsquo;em you&rsquo;d never been near here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell &rsquo;em I&rsquo;ll come peaceably, Buddy,&rdquo; said the editor wearily. He
      turned to Andrew Galpin. &ldquo;Andy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay-ah?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure this is straight? You&rsquo;re sure you&rsquo;re not the one that&rsquo;s
      crazy? Or I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I sure! Go out the front way, Boss, and see the line waiting. That&rsquo;ll
      convince you. I tell you, unless something busts, we&rsquo;ll win out sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hardly could the editor and owner of The Guardian, led away by Doc
      Summerfield in deep disgrace, assimilate the hope of ultimate victory for
      his paper and himself. He dared not let himself believe in it yet, because
      of the intruding thought of Marcia and of what triumph might mean to him.

      CHAPTER XX
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">C</span>LICK-CLICK!
      Click-click! Clickety-click! One hundred pairs of knitting needles
      furnished a subdued castanet accompaniment to the voice of a long, lean
      lady-droner who stood upon the platform of the Fenchester Club Auditorium,
      and read from a typed list. At times she referred to various issues of The
      Guardian ranged on a flag-bedecked table. And at times the clickers paused
      to make notes in small books wherewith they had provided themselves for
      that very purpose. The gathering was the every morning meeting of the
      Fenchester Ladies War Reading Club.
    </p>
    <p>
      Socially it was a comprehensively representative gathering, and something
      more. Pretty much every family whose comings and goings were wont to be
      entered (by Buddy Higman or some other arbiter of the elegancies) in The
      Guardian&rsquo;s Society Notes had at least one member present. Sprinkled among
      the women who made up the active list of membership were a few associate
      members, mere males, and in the presiding officer&rsquo;s chair sat Mr. Montrose
      Clark; for, after the regular proceedings of the day, special business was
      in order.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Rappelje, the secretary, read from her list: &ldquo;Nicholas Engel, grocer.
      Last year, two columns a week, average. Since The Fair Dealer
      announcement, half a column.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The castanet chorus diminished while the knitters and crocheters entered a
      note against Herr Engel&rsquo;s grocery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Fliess Brewing Company,&rdquo; continued the reader. &ldquo;Last year five
      columns; now, none.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hurray for Prohibition! Beer&rsquo;s a German drink anyway,&rdquo; cried a voice, and
      there was a wave of laughter as the clicking resumed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Great Northwestern Stores. Last year three full pages, regularly, and
      on special sales as high as five&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me.&rdquo; A member rose in the center of the house. &ldquo;Mr. Ahrens sent a
      representative to tell me that, in spite of unsettled conditions, they
      have contracted to use more space in The Guardian than ever before, and to
      ask me to report it here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let &rsquo;em!&rdquo; commented a determined and ominous voice. &ldquo;I shall wait
      and see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From the murmur of assent which greeted this, it was evident that many
      would wait and see. So the reading went on, through dairies, laundries,
      undertakers, soft drinks, ice dealers, stationers, milliners, garages, all
      the lines of industry which bid in print for trade, while the knitters
      alternately toiled and made their notes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside, in a small anteroom off the stage, Mr. Jeremy Robson put his
      obstinate head down and balked. Ten days&rsquo; enforced rest, except for his
      one escape, had gone far to restore him to fitness. Now he fended off
      Judge Selden Dana and demanded enlightenment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a step farther till I know what I&rsquo;m up against,&rdquo; he declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All you have to do,&rdquo; returned the lawyer soothingly, &ldquo;is to trust to me
      and do as I tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that all!&rdquo; retorted Jeremy, with intent. &ldquo;Who are these people outside
      and what are they doing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re your well-earned enemies, and they&rsquo;re saving the paper for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somebody&rsquo;s certainly done a job in that direction.-But how? These sound
      like mostly women.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So they are. As to how they&rsquo;re pulling your paper through, that&rsquo;s the
      simplest thing in the world. We got up a War Reading Club.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reading Club,&rdquo; repeated Jeremy. &ldquo;Perfectly simple! Of course! Andy Galpin
      <i>said</i> the whole town had gone crazy since I was laid up. Andy was
      right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A great authority once proposed a classic question: &lsquo;Who&rsquo;s loony now?&rsquo;
      Wait until you hear the rest of this. The club meets here every morning to
      do knitting and other war-work while certain extracts from the local
      papers are read to them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good idea,&rdquo; remarked Jeremy, weary but polite. &ldquo;Shall I have something
      put in the paper about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My Lord, no!&rdquo; almost shouted Dana.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy leaped in his chair. &ldquo;I wish you would n&rsquo;t do that sort of thing,&rdquo;
       he protested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still a bit jumpy? Well, I&rsquo;ll explain in words of one syllable. But first
      apply your eye to this peep-hole and tell me what you think of our
      membership.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doing as he was directed, the editor looked out over what, in earlier
      days, he would have identified as a mass-meeting of The Guardian&rsquo;s
      enemies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much purchasing power per year in the local stores would you suppose
      they represent?&rdquo; asked Dana. &ldquo;A big lot. Quarter of a million, maybe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nearer twice that. Now, we&rsquo;ve got a little committee called the Committee
      on Selective Reading. I happen to be chairman of it. Our committee chooses
      what advertisements&mdash;you get that, Jem?&mdash;what advertisements
      shall be read each day. That&rsquo;s our White List. Our members deal only with
      merchants whose loyalty is above suspicion. What would you think of the
      loyalty of an advertiser who quit The Guardian to go into The Fair
      Dealer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask me. I&rsquo;m prejudiced.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So is the War Reading Club. It&rsquo;s my committee&rsquo;s business to keep &rsquo;em
      prejudiced&mdash;against any merchant who advertises in the wrong place.
      Now, our theory is that our members read no advertisements, themselves,
      and don&rsquo;t intend to; certainly not after The Fair Dealer appears.
      Therefore they know of the local advertising only as the Committee on
      Selective Reading chooses it for them. That&rsquo;s the <i>theory</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the fact?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fact is that ninety-nine per cent of those women will see any
      merchant in town doubly damned before they spend a cent in his shop unless
      he sticks by The Guardian as long as The Guardian sticks by the country.
      Do you get it now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boycott!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And blackmail. You should have seen the weak-kneed among the store-people
      when we let our programme leak out! You heard part of it from Galpin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dana,&rdquo; said the editor, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;d told me this before, you&rsquo;d have saved
      me some mighty tough days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t risk it. Can&rsquo;t you see that we&rsquo;ve been skirting the ragged edge
      of the law? If you&rsquo;d been in on it, The Fair Dealer could have charged
      conspiracy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why tell me now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We-ell, we can&rsquo;t work under cover much longer. Besides, I doubt if
      there&rsquo;s much of any fight left in Embree and his crowd.&rdquo; He peered out
      through the peep-hole. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve turned it into an experience meeting now,&rdquo;
       he remarked. &ldquo;Then you come on. They&rsquo;re expecting you. Will you come
      peaceably or be escorted?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me keep out of sight until it&rsquo;s my turn, anyway,&rdquo; pleaded Jeremy.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the lawyer, leading him in, established him behind a wing where he was
      half-hidden, and placed himself as a screen. As he settled himself down, a
      plump and luxuriously dressed woman at the rear of the hall rose and said
      austerely:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I disapprove The Guardian&rsquo;s local policy. I consider it unfair and
      prejudiced against&mdash;er&mdash;ah&mdash;against our kind of people. But
      while we are at war I agree to support it loyally and to deal only with
      those who support it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are my eyes playing tricks?&rdquo; whispered Jeremy in Dana&rsquo;s ear. &ldquo;Or is that
      Mrs. Ambrose Galsworth, who tried to have me blackballed at the Canoe
      Club?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a new member. Wait! There&rsquo;s worse to come,&rdquo; chuckled the lawyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little, lean, brisk, twinkling old maid projected herself out of her
      seat with a jumping-jack effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never expected to live to see the day I&rsquo;d speak for The Guardian after
      they printed that awful political attack on my dear uncle,&rdquo; she declared.
      &ldquo;But the country first! Put down Celia Jenney on your list. And&rdquo;&mdash;her
      black bright eyes snapped out sparks&mdash;&ldquo;if there&rsquo;s a store in town
      that don&rsquo;t want my trade while this war is on, all it has to do is to take
      its advertising out of The Guardian and put it into The Fair Dealer&mdash;if
      that&rsquo;s its silly name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She spends only about fifteen thousand a year in this town,&rdquo; observed
      Dana aside to Jeremy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No wonder the advertisers have been falling over themselves to get back
      into the paper!&rdquo; murmured the editor.
    </p>
    <p>
      After further informal pledges the chairman called for reports from the
      &ldquo;Missionary Workers.&rdquo; Up rose Aider-man Crobin&mdash;Crooked Crobin, as
      The Guardian had dubbed him for years.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;T&rsquo;ree of my constitchoonts assured me this mahmin&rsquo;&mdash;voluntarily, ye
      ondherstand; quite voluntarily&mdash;that they are cancelin&rsquo; their
      contract wid th&rsquo; noo paper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A tall, pale young woman rose in the center of the house, and as she
      moistened her nervous lips a murmur and a rustle swept over the audience;
      for this was Mrs. Dennis Robbins, Governor Embree&rsquo;s sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I bring five pledges of advertisers to stand by The Guardian&mdash;and
      America,&rdquo; she said in a low voice; and a quick ripple of sympathetic
      applause answered her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before it had died away, old Madam Taylor rustled silkily to her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the tax-dodger,&rdquo; she cackled. &ldquo;See The Guardian if you don&rsquo;t believe
      it. But I never dodged a good fight. Two stores that I trade with cut down
      their advertising in The Guardian. So I cut down my trade with them. I cut
      it down to nothing. Now I understand they feel differently about the
      paper,&rdquo; she concluded malevolently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up popped pursy little Mrs. Stockmuller. &ldquo;Me, I quit Ahrens anyway,&rdquo; she
      announced, and sat down flushed with the resultant applause of the
      multitude and suddenly conscious of latent and hitherto unsuspected
      capabilities as a public speaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then little Anne Serviss pledged the support of three hundred University
      girls, and following her, the Reverend Mr. Merserole reared himself
      impressively into sight and hearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Inter arma, rixæ minores silent,&rdquo; he proclaimed oracularly, &ldquo;if my friend
      Judge Dana, whom I observe upon the stage, will permit me to alter a legal
      proverb to fit the occasion. &lsquo;In time of war, lesser quarrels are
      stilled.&rsquo; Many of us have had our&mdash;er&mdash;trials with The Guardian.
      But all that is forgotten in the larger cause. I beg to report, Mr.
      Chairman, that eighteen members of my church&mdash;leading members, I may
      add&mdash;have signed an agreement to advertise in no local morning paper
      during the war.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s boycott and against the law, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; queried some cautious
      member.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dana jumped to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let &rsquo;em take it up!&rdquo; he cried, his face lighted by a joyous snarl.
      &ldquo;Just let us get &rsquo;em into court on it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A shout answered him. There was no mistaking the temper of that crowd.
      Friends or enemies of The Guardian&rsquo;s lesser policies, they were shoulder
      to shoulder now in the common cause. A conservative old judge was just
      resuming his seat, after reporting, when the door was jerked open and
      there burst into the aisle Andrew Galpin, livid with the excitement of
      great tidings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve quit!&rdquo; he shouted. Then, recalling himself to the proprieties, he
      added: &ldquo;I beg pardon, Mr. Chairman. But they&rsquo;ve quit!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Montrose Clark rose. &ldquo;Mr. Andrew Galpin, of The Guardian,&rdquo; he
      announced. &ldquo;Mr. Galpin has, perhaps, matter of interest to present before
      this meeting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve quit. That&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; said the excited Galpin. His wild and roving
      glance fell upon Jeremy Robson who had incautiously moved forward at sight
      of his associate, and the last vestige of parliamentary decorum departed
      from him. &ldquo;Do you get that, Boss?&rdquo; he bellowed. &ldquo;The Botches have quit. We
      win.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s quit?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s a Botch?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Platform!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell us about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s a Botch?&rdquo; repeated the general manager. &ldquo;Bausch is a Botch.
      Wanser&rsquo;s a Botch. The Deutscher Club&rsquo;s a batch of Botches. &lsquo;Smiling Mart&rsquo;
      Embree&rsquo;s a Botch, The Fair Dealer would have been a Botch, but there is
      n&rsquo;t going to be any Fair Dealer. They could n&rsquo;t stand the gaff you folks
      put to &rsquo;em. Publication day&rsquo;s indefinitely postponed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hardly had he finished when Jeremy Robson found himself being hustled by
      Judge Dana and the chairman, who had possessed themselves of an arm
      apiece, to the front of the platform. The house rose to him in a burst of
      acclaim. He looked out, with nerves aquiver, across that waiting audience
      of one-time enemies, opponents bitter and implacable, bitterly and
      implacably fought in many an unforgotten campaign; now his allies,
      rallying to a service greater than all past hatreds, higher than all past
      loyalties.
    </p>
    <p>
      Judge Dana&rsquo;s words echoed back to him: &ldquo;In the same cause&mdash;with the
      last drop of blood&mdash;to the finish!&rdquo; What terms could he find wherein
      to speak to these, his enemies of old, looking up at him with such
      befriending eyes?
    </p>
    <p>
      Montrose Clark had delivered himself of a hurried and unheeded
      introduction, and now Jeremy stood, with shaking knees, gazing down at
      them. Opportunely and suddenly the parable of Nick Milliken came into his
      mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friends,&rdquo; he said unsteadily, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t make you a speech. There are
      n&rsquo;t thanks made for this sort of thing. But I can tell you the parable of
      Milliken. You know Milliken, the Socialist&mdash;one of us. He was talking
      to a bunch that were ripe for a strike, arguing against it because it
      would hinder one little corner of our war. This is what he told them: &lsquo;All
      my life,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been fighting Wall Street and the firm of J. P.
      Morgan &amp; Company. I&rsquo;m against everything they represent. I expect to
      go on fighting them the rest of my life. But if I were walking down the
      street with Mr. Morgan and we met a mad wolf in the road I&rsquo;d say to him:
      &ldquo;Pierpont, let&rsquo;s get together and kill that wolf. Our little scrap can
      wait.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s what Milliken told them, my friends. That&rsquo;s all I can say to
      you now. We&rsquo;ve had our differences, you and I. We&rsquo;ll have them again. They
      seemed big and bitter at the time. How little they seem now! For now we&rsquo;re
      facing the mad wolf of Germany right here in Centralia. He&rsquo;s in the heart
      of our State. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get him out! Our little scrap can wait!&rdquo;&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They rose to him again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, God bless your dear hearts,&rdquo; cried young Jeremy Robson with shining
      eyes and outstretched hands, &ldquo;how can we ever fight each other after
      this!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Up in a far corner of the gallery a pair of strong, little, sun-tanned,
      eager, tremulous hands went forth involuntarily as if to meet Jeremy&rsquo;s,
      unseen.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      While that very unliterary and decidedly militant organization, the
      Fenchester War Reading Club, was pouring forward to overwhelm the editor
      of The Guardian, there gathered in the little side room a hasty and
      earnest conference of three. Andrew Galpin and Montrose Clark having left
      it, the lone survivor, Judge Selden Dana, remained to catch Jeremy as he
      came out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jem,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve won.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks to you people!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks to a good fight. Galpin tells me The Fair Dealer backers are
      through. We&rsquo;ve scared the local advertisers out of their contracts and the
      paper can&rsquo;t hold &rsquo;em because of the change of publication date.
      Verrall made a fatal break when he put a date in that contract. They&rsquo;re
      through. But The Fair Dealer is going on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! Who&rsquo;s going to back it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Montrose Clark. He&rsquo;s going to take it over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For his corporation campaign. I see. Then this means another fight of
      another kind on my hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s going to use it to beat out Martin Embree with his own candidate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy&rsquo;s eyes narrowed. &ldquo;You know The Guardian can&rsquo;t and won&rsquo;t stand for
      you fellows&rsquo; kind of candidate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll stand for this one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jeremy Robson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jer&mdash;Andy was right, <i>sure!</i>&rdquo; gasped the other. &ldquo;The town has
      gone crazy and I&rsquo;ve gone with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On a platform of Centralia for the War,&rdquo; continued the other. &ldquo;Now put
      your lower jaw back on its hinges and I&rsquo;ll explain how this is n&rsquo;t as
      crazy from our point of view as you&rsquo;d think. You&rsquo;ll be elected&mdash;for
      we&rsquo;ll lick &lsquo;Smiling Mart&rsquo;&mdash;only for the unfinished term. The war will
      last that long, and while the war lasts internal polides don&rsquo;t matter.
      After the war&mdash;why, we&rsquo;ll have a newspaper of our own to lick you
      with when you come up for reelection.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you a good run both ways,&rdquo; promised Jeremy. And the two men
      soberly shook hands upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a scheme; the woman&rsquo;s boycott!&rdquo; said Jeremy presently. &ldquo;I might have
      known that was your fine Italian hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was n&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No? Who did work it out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A much cleverer politician than I ever thought of being.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t no sich animule,&rdquo; denied Jeremy. &ldquo;Show it to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been sitting at the feet of Wisdom, Wile, and Woman. Her other
      name,&rdquo; said Judge Dana, &ldquo;is Marcia Ames. And my professional advice to you
      is to be on your way.&rdquo;

    </h2>

      &ldquo;In dreams she grows not older

      The lands of Dream among&mdash;&rdquo;

    <p>

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE deep, soft
      thrill of the contralto voice floated through the warm air on invisible
      wings. The listener, coming softly up the pathway of the old garden,
      paused to hearken, to drink it in, with the fragrance of the late roses,
      the wine of the sun-drenched air, the peace of the shaded ways, all the
      other lovelinesses of a world suddenly blessed to his soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      The voice faltered and sank, at the sound of his foot upon the steps. The
      singer&rsquo;s hands strayed like suddenly affrighted things among the keys of
      the piano. She stood to face him as he entered, and of all the tremulous,
      tender beauty of her, only her eyes meeting and merging with his, were
      unwavering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jem!&rdquo; she said, very low.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marcia!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She lifted her arms as he crossed swiftly to her, and clung to him, and
      gave him her lips in glad and complete surrender, while he held her close
      and murmured to her the words that he had been so hungry to speak, she so
      hungry to hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jem,&rdquo; she whispered presently, &ldquo;you cannot give me up now, Jem.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never did, dear love,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &ldquo;Though all the world wax colder,
    </p>

    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, but you did. You tried. How could you even try!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never did. Not really. Not for a moment. Not even when I thought you
      had married some one else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She moved in his arms to hide her eyes against his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must have known that I never could,&rdquo; she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see,&rdquo; he pursued eagerly, &ldquo;that if I had really given you up, I
      should have given up the paper, the fight, everything? Don&rsquo;t you see that,
      love?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; that is true,&rdquo; she assented sweetly. &ldquo;That must be true. Though
      perhaps you did not know it.... Ah, Jem, but I have wearied for you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When&rsquo;s the very earliest you can marry me, dearest?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked up at him with her level and fearless eyes. &ldquo;Any time, Jem.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m asking a lot of you,&rdquo; he said, his eager face clouding for the
      moment. &ldquo;It is n&rsquo;t all plain sailing yet; and there won&rsquo;t be so much to
      live on even here. If we go to Washington you&rsquo;ll find it doubly hard, I&rsquo;m
      afraid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I have my own money, Jem. And what is this about Washington?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said he casually; &ldquo;they want to nominate me for the Senate, against
      Mart Embree.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jem! You will take it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If my liege lady approves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course she approves. It is wonderful. How could you keep it to
      yourself! Why did you not tell me the instant you came?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you see, I was intent on other matters,&rdquo; said Jem, looking down
      into the flushed and adorable face, which flushed the more adorably at his
      words. He bent to her. &ldquo;Dearest of my heart,&rdquo; he said passionately, &ldquo;what
      does it all matter in comparison with you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Stepping gloriously from rose-tipped cloud to rose-tipped cloud as youth
      may do when winged with happiness and love, Jeremy, on his way
      office-ward, presently found himself at the Inter-Urban terminal being
      accosted by a man who said: &ldquo;If you are deaf, I can make signs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; apologized Jeremy hastily. &ldquo;Were you speaking to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only three times,&rdquo; said the stranger. &ldquo;So far,&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus recalled from his castle-building the editor contemplated his
      interceptor. The man was a stranger in town. He carried a small,
      nondescript bag. He looked like a country minister on a week-day, or a
      prosperous plumber off the job, or a middle-aged clerk on an errand, or
      any one of a hundred other everyday individuals. In fact he was in face,
      figure, dress, and manner, the most commonplace, humdrum, unremarkable,
      completely average individual that Jeremy had ever encountered. He might
      have posed as the composite photograph of a convention of ten thousand
      Average Citizens.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was asking you: do you know this city,&rdquo; he was saying patiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Jeremy possessed a singularly retentive visual memory. This memory had
      suddenly started working with a jar. &ldquo;I do,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Do I know you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not,&rdquo; said the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure,&rdquo; retorted Jeremy. &ldquo;I seem to remember a talk at the
      Owl&rsquo;s Nest in Philadelphia, six years ago or so, by a distinguished
      globe-trotter and war correspondent. Now if you had n&rsquo;t told me that I did
      not know you, I would have said&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would have thought,&rdquo; corrected the stranger, without the flicker of
      an eyelid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would have thought you were that lecturer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Likenesses are deceptive,&rdquo; observed the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, in spite of your new mustache, remembering a meeting at the Lion
      d&rsquo;Or just off the Place Clichy a year later, I would have said&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would have thought,&rdquo; interpolated the other, imperturbably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would have thought that you were still the same, and I would have said&mdash;that
      is, I would have thought that your name was Jerome Tillinghast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you would n&rsquo;t say it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not on any account, if there is good reason against it in the opinion of
      Jerome Tillinghast&mdash;who, by the way, did n&rsquo;t have that furrow over
      his temple when I knew him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shrapnel,&rdquo; explained the other. &ldquo;Russian campaign. Got me in the leg,
      too. So they packed me home, and Uncle Sam set me to work. My official
      name is James Tilley. And yours?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy explained himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Guardian, eh? You&rsquo;re the last man in town I&rsquo;d have looked up. But now
      that I&rsquo;ve met you, I&rsquo;ll just mention that Washington thinks pretty well of
      The Guardian. Keep it up, my boy. And now, where would I be likely to find
      a bold and dashing patriot, by name, Emil Bausch?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy gave the directions. James Tilley thanked him. &ldquo;Nobody ever
      recognizes me,&rdquo; he observed, &ldquo;or notices me, or remembers me. I&rsquo;m such a
      common article. That&rsquo;s all that makes me valuable. So kindly forget all
      this. And good-bye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Five minutes later he was sitting in Emil Bausch&rsquo;s private office
      explaining to that perturbed gentleman certain supposedly very private
      matters in connection with a chemical project in one phase of which Bausch
      had acted for a certain otherwise unidentified &ldquo;Mr. Stern.&rdquo; Bausch was
      loftily contemptuous, though nervous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The other details,&rdquo; said the caller pleasantly, &ldquo;are entered in Ledger M,
      under the cipher of X-32, formerly kept at 60 Wall Street.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bausch gulped twice and said he had never heard of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fortunate for you,&rdquo; returned the other. &ldquo;Take my advice and don&rsquo;t hear of
      it. Don&rsquo;t have any part in it. Don&rsquo;t do business with people who have.
      Trouble lies that way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thereafter Mr. Bausch repaired to the Deutscher Club where he had several
      more beers than was his wont, and subsequently delivered himself of
      touching appreciations of free speech and the privileges of American
      citizenship. He wound up, after dinner, by declaring to a puzzled
      assemblage that he knew his rights and was n&rsquo;t afraid of anybody, even if
      he did come from Washington and wear a tin shield.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime a supremely ordinary appearing person contrived to get himself
      admitted to the President&rsquo;s room of the Fenchester Trust Company, and
      introduced himself to Robert Wanser, who found his bearing, mild though it
      was, distinctly antipathetic. In a voice so quiet as to give the effect of
      being meek, the intruder ventured to advise Mr. Wanser to shun the
      Deutscher Club.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go to the devil!&rdquo; retorted Mr. Wanser, whose nerves had been recently
      frazzled by local as well as national events.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m giving you the opposite advice,&rdquo; returned the other equably. &ldquo;Keep
      away from the Deutscher Club.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Save your advice for those who want it. Who are you, anyway?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;James Tilley, at your service. Sent here from Washington to help you
      avoid trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The word &ldquo;Washington&rdquo; fell chill upon the banker&rsquo;s ear. Nevertheless, he
      blustered &ldquo;The Deutscher Club is my club. The Government cannot tell a
      private citizen to keep away from a private club.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But a well-wisher&mdash;such as myself&mdash;may suggest that he find his
      amusements elsewhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well-wisher! A(c)h! Spy. Is this a free country? In Germany one would not
      be so oppressed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is not Germany. Bear that in mind. The Deutscher Club <i>is</i>&mdash;or
      something like it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, by the way, tell your wife&mdash;Bertha Wanser is your wife, isn&rsquo;t
      she? Exactly! She talks too much. Propaganda. Tell her to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vimmen, too!&rdquo; snarled the other. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t even keep your hands off
      vimmen. Tell her yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      James Tilley sighed. &ldquo;I will,&rdquo; he said, and departed, leaving an irritant,
      disconcerting and healthily prudent impress upon the mind of the grandson
      of &rsquo;48.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Mrs. Wanser, she was profoundly displeased with the face, apparel,
      carriage, and particularly the manner of her unknown caller, which was
      abrupt and brusque.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You go to the motion pictures, madam,&rdquo; he stated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, wondering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the 11th you were at the Gayety. A Four-Minute-Man spoke. You
      protested to the management.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did. I told the manager he&rsquo;d lose my custom if they let such nonsense
      go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The speaker was Professor Brender, of the University&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A German,&rdquo; she broke in. &ldquo;And he gets up in public and makes shame of
      Germany.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As a Four-Minute-Man he speaks with the authority of the Government. On
      the 14th you protested to the Orpheum.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You been spying on me,&rdquo; said the lady, wrathfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. You&rsquo;re a suspicious person. Take my advice. Stop talking, or
      if you must talk, talk like an American. Propaganda is a dangerous game.
      Go to those two movie managers and withdraw&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she declared, pale with fury.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you will. Ask your husband. And do as he tells you. He&rsquo;ll tell
      you just what I have&mdash;if he&rsquo;s wise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For all his modest disavowals of being able to make an impression upon
      people, there were now at least three individuals in Fenchester who would
      hold in tenacious and painful memory to the last day of their lives the
      smallest detail of James Tilley&rsquo;s unremarkable personality. He now
      proceeded to enlarge the list. Whether by chance or by design, he
      encountered Pastor Klink, who was doing some quiet research work in
      connection with back files of the newspapers, in the City Library, and
      Pastor Klink took the next train for home and a reflective silence. He met
      with the Reverend Theo Gunst and that fervid theologian retired to draft
      an editorial for the leading German religious weekly, reeking with
      protestations of loyalty, which almost tore his agonized heart out by its
      Teutonic roots. He ran across Gordon Fliess and earnestly counseled him
      against the strain of frequent railway journeys between Bellair and
      Fenchester. On the other hand, and as indicating a certain amiable
      flexibility of view on his part, he dropped in upon A. M. Wymett to extol
      the broadening influence of travel. A. M. Wymett traveled.
    </p>
    <p>
      He called upon Vogt and Niebuhr, and Henry Dolge, the educational expert,
      leaving behind him devastated areas of alarm, caution, and at least
      temporary silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within two days after his arrival, though he had said no word nor even
      given any hint upon either point, the Deutscher Club burst into a riot of
      American flags, and Martin Embree made a speech so full of patriotic
      pathos that it brought tears to the eyes of his hearers, particularly the
      Germans.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bausch, and Niebuhr, and Dolge, and a few others of the old school,
      however, took to meeting in a respectable saloon kept by one Muller down
      in &ldquo;the Ward.&rdquo; To them came Gordon Fliess, and influential men from the
      Northern Tier, for conference. What passed there was asserted to be
      perfectly loyal, and supposed to be quite private....
    </p>
    <p>
      But within a fortnight, James Tilley, more unobtrusive than ever, stepped
      off another Inter-Urban trolley, and stayed over one train. Thence he went
      to Bellair, and so passes into his chosen obscurity. He gave no advice
      this time. Not, at least, to Bausch, or Dolge, Niebuhr, or the respectable
      saloon-keeper, Muller; neither to Gordon Fliess. But the respectable
      saloon unostentatiously ceased to exist. And its more than respectable
      patrons named above quietly vanished, and the places that had known them
      knew them no more. Observing which, the more cautious Robert Wanser
      trembled, and congratulated himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deutschtum, hitherto hardly bent, was now broken in the State of
      Centralia.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXII
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">P</span>ATRIOTISM had
      waxed and politics waned with the ebbing of the year 1917, in Centralia.
      Through the murk and fume of alien treachery, enemy propaganda, and the
      reckless self-seeking of petty partisanship had burst a clear, high,
      consuming flame of Americanism. Lesser matters were forgotten in the
      maintenance of that beacon-fire. Men of all types of political belief, of
      all classes, of all economic and social creeds, had abandoned their
      private feuds and bitternesses in the fervor against the common enemy. To
      them had rallied the finer and more courageous element of the
      German-Americans, some impulsively from emotion and sentiment like
      Stock-muller and Blasius, others, in the pain and travail of old ties
      broken and from the profound conviction of loyalty and right, like
      Professor Brender. Centralia, thirty years before marked by Deutschtum to
      be the Little Germany of the New World, was slowly, doggedly establishing
      its birthright of Americanism.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poison still lurked in its system. There were whisperings in dark corners.
      The German-language press still gave heart-service to the Kaiser&rsquo;s cause
      in hint and suggestion and innuendo, while giving lip-service to the cause
      of the United States in artificial and machine-made editorials. The German
      pulpit, preaching an ineradicable Germanism by the very use of the German
      tongue, was lack-loyal where it dared not be disloyal. Over many a Verein
      and Bund and Gesellschaft the Stars and Stripes waved above seething
      revolt of spirit. Workers in all patriotic causes felt the dead-weight of
      a sullen, unworded, untraceable opposition clogging their efforts. But all
      this was negative. Deutschtum, a few short months before so arrogant and
      confident of its power over Centralia, was on its defense. More; it was in
      hiding. No other one force had done so much to drive it thither as that
      once yellow mongrel of journalism, The Fenchester Guardian.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Guardian&rsquo;s den was brightly lighted on this December evening of 1917.
      It was brightly lighted on most evenings. Yet Doc Summerfield, aforetime
      of a pessimistic view regarding the effect of night-labor upon Jeremy
      Robson, was obliged to admit that he showed a steady improvement in spite
      of apparent overwork. Perhaps this was because he had provided himself
      with a highly valued assistant. The assistant was seated opposite the
      chief, reading proof on an editorial, when the door opened, and in stalked
      Andrew Galpin, traveling-bag in hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Bosses!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Andy,&rdquo; said his chief; and &ldquo;Welcome back, Andy,&rdquo; said the
      assistant getting up to perch upon the arm of the chief editorial chair,
      thus leaving a seat for the general manager, who took it with a nod.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw Cassius Kimball,&rdquo; he stated. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s just back from Washington.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any new&rsquo;s?&rdquo; asked Jeremy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve located Emil Bausch. But not for publication.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Behind two row&rsquo;s of barbed wire, one of &rsquo;em charged with
      electricity, in a pleasant Southern camp. He&rsquo;s a member of the
      Millionaires&rsquo; Club, there. They caught him on that chemical deal. Supposed
      to be wholesale drugs; really high explosives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any other of our extinguished local lights heard from?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Muller, the saloon-keeper, is down there, too. But not in the
      Millionaires&rsquo; Club. He&rsquo;s gardening. One dollar per diem. Martin Dolge is
      in Mexico.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about Gunst and Klink and the church outfit?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve promised to be good. Three of their religious weeklies are
      scheduled to quit. Gordon Fliess has dropped his financial support of the
      German-American dailies. We&rsquo;re going to go stale for lack of opposition&rsquo;
      if this keeps on,&rdquo; prophesied Andy sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cassius did n&rsquo;t run across Mart Embree down there, did he?&rdquo; queried
      Jeremy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay-ah. He did. Says &lsquo;Smiling Mart&rsquo; was running around like a little,
      worried dog, wagging his tail anxiously and trying to make his peace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peace is still Governor Embree&rsquo;s specialty, then?&rdquo; put in the assistant,
      from her perch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I guess it always will be, so long as there&rsquo;s a German vote in
      Centralia,&rdquo; returned the general manager. &ldquo;But what does &lsquo;Smiling Mart&rsquo;
      amount to, now? We&rsquo;ve got the whole bunch licked to a frazzle, and licked
      for keeps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think so. So easily?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Andy Galpin looked intently at Mrs. Jeremy Robson. &ldquo;Maybe I&rsquo;m wrong,&rdquo; he
      said meekly. &ldquo;You think it is n&rsquo;t over?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little, tawny head was shaken emphatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think that we shall have it all to fight again,&rdquo; she said, in her
      unchanged, precise, and subtly caressing manner of speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When?&rdquo; The chief and the general manager challenged her with one voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When Germany&rsquo;s peace offer is made. Then you will see Governor Embree and
      all that is left of Germany here making their fight for a peace which will
      be worse than war. That is why I will not listen to Jem&rsquo;s giving up the
      paper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think of that, Andy?&rdquo; asked Jem.
    </p>
    <p>
      The general manager smiled his slow, homely, friendly smile at Marcia
      Robson. &ldquo;I think what I&rsquo;ve thought since the first minute I set eyes on
      her,&rdquo; he said: &ldquo;that she&rsquo;s a wise guy. Boss, we haven&rsquo;t won this war over
      here until we&rsquo;ve won this war over there, and don&rsquo;t you forget it! By the
      way, there&rsquo;s quite a little talk in Washington, Kimball tells me, about
      the new Senator-elect from Centralia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I blush, modestly and prettily,&rdquo; retorted Jem. &ldquo;Or&mdash;Marcia, you do
      it for me. I&rsquo;d rather stay here and run the old Guardian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather have you,&rdquo; returned Andy, with rueful emphasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall be back for the fight that is coming,&rdquo; promised Marcia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Galpin&rsquo;s eyes wandered slowly about the room and returned upon Marcia. &ldquo;It
      gives me the shivers,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to think how near we were to losing out
      on the whole fight when Buddy Higman went and got you. I&rsquo;d like to have
      heard Buddy&rsquo;s argument.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was effective,&rdquo; laughed Marcia. &ldquo;Buddy was honestly convinced that
      without The Guardian to guide it, the Nation would go to immediate
      destruction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Buddy&rsquo;s little plan turned out well for him,&rdquo; observed Jem. &ldquo;Marcia is
      sending him to Old Central in the fall. Sort of a fairy godmother, aren&rsquo;t
      you?&rdquo; he added, looking up at his wife. &ldquo;Pull the paper through with one
      hand, save us all, and make a man of Buddy with the other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not give me too much credit,&rdquo; said Marcia, more gravely. &ldquo;It was Andy
      who really held you here when you wished to go into the army.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well, I had my stake in the paper, too,&rdquo; disclaimed the general
      manager, picking up his valise and hat. &ldquo;Good-night, Bosses,&rdquo; he added.
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t overwork and spoil your beauty, you two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marcia,&rdquo; said Jem, after their aide had gone. &ldquo;That night when you came
      back&mdash;don&rsquo;t go away while I&rsquo;m talking seriously, please!&mdash;would
      you really have married me, right away, then and there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, I would. I meant to. You were very cruel. You spoiled my
      plans.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He regarded her with suspicion. Was there a note of raillery in the sweet,
      even voice?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What plans?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, to marry you then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To put my money into the paper and keep you from selling it, of course.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if I would n&rsquo;t have taken it? And I would n&rsquo;t, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would not have made the slightest difference,&rdquo; she said calmly. &ldquo;You
      could not have sold the paper, in any case, if you had married me when&mdash;when
      I proposed to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could n&rsquo;t I! I&rsquo;d have had to, if matters had gone on as they were going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. For you could not have sold the paper without the plant, and the
      plant being real estate, could not be transferred without the wife&rsquo;s
      consent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it couldn&rsquo;t! You wretched little plotter! Who put you up to that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I consulted a lawyer,&rdquo; she replied demurely. &ldquo;On a hypothetical case.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m jealous,&rdquo; declared Jem. &ldquo;You were trying to marry me for my property
      and not for my winning self. Was that the only reason?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her face changed adorably as she bent over him. &ldquo;What do you think?&rdquo; she
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I wanted to have&mdash;what is it Andy called it?&mdash;a stake in
      the paper, too,&rdquo; she continued, after a moment. &ldquo;You have never let me. Do
      you think that is fair?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the only fair way. We&rsquo;re not out of the woods yet, with The
      Guardian. Newspaper property is going to be mighty uncertain before this
      war is over, and I don&rsquo;t want you involved in it. The Guardian has taken
      you in, little wife, but it won&rsquo;t take your money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not even if you should need it? To save the paper?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not even then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jem, I&mdash;I want a&mdash;a stake in the paper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Marcia! What is it, dearest? You&rsquo;re not crying, are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I <i>think</i> not. If I am, it is for happiness, Jem. I&mdash;I have
      a&mdash;a special stake now in the paper. I want to keep The Guardian to
      hand it down to&mdash;to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marcia!&rdquo; He turned in the circle of her arms, but for once the frank eyes
      were hidden from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;to our son,&rdquo; said the soft voice with a little catch in it. &ldquo;I am
      sure it will be a son, Jem. If we name him Jeremy Andrew Robson&rdquo;&mdash;the
      voice was muffled now against Jem&rsquo;s cheek&mdash;&ldquo;he will be almost The
      Guardian&rsquo;s child&mdash;next to being ours, Jem.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jem drew a long, deep breath of happiness. &ldquo;There&rsquo;ll always be a good
      fight for a hundred per cent American paper like The Guardian to get into.
      That&rsquo;s the real best of the business, I guess.&rdquo; He bent over the little,
      proud, bowed head. &ldquo;I hope he&rsquo;ll be as good an American as his mother,&rdquo; he
      said.
    </p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply

posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project

  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
